 Reserve Bank of Australia lifts interest rates 0.25% to 5.5% despite signs of a slowdown in the country's economy . New figures show a fall in economic growth in the last quarter . The Bank said it had acted to curb inflation but the move was criticised by some analysts . The Australian government said the economy remained strong with unemployment at a near 30 year low . However, opposition parties and some analysts say the move is ill-timed given data showing the Australian economy grew just 0.1% between October and December and 1 .5% on an annual basis . At 2.6%, inflation remains within the Bank's 2-3% target range but exports declined in the second half of 2004, fuelling a rise in Australia's current account deficit to a record Australian dollar 29.4bn . The rate hike was well-flagged in advance and had been well-feared in advance by the Bank of the Reserve Bank and the Australian Treasurer Peter Costello said .
