 The V8 Vantage will be available in the UK in late summer . It will be built at the new Aston factory in Gaydon, near Warwick, and should more than double Aston's total output from about 2,000 . The Vantage is "the most important car in the history of the brand", says Aston's chief executive . There is currently an 18 months waiting list for the DB9, which will cost Â£80,000 more than the V8 . The new car will be unveiled at the Geneva Motor Show on Thursday .
