 FAO warns on impact of subsidies and protectionism . 2.5 billion people in the developing world who rely on farming face food insecurity . Almost 30 wealthy nations spend more than $300bn (Â£158.8bn; 230.9bn euros) in agricultural subsidies . The FAO has urged the World Trade Organisation to swiftly conclude negotiations to liberalise trade, easing developing countries' access to the world market . It recommends that developing countries reduce their own tariffs to encourage trade and take advantage of market liberalisation .
