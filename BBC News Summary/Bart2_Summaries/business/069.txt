 Boeing unveils new long-distance 777 plane, as it tries to regain its position as the industry's leading manufacturer . The 777-200LR will be capable of flying almost 11,000 miles non-stop, linking cities such as London and Sydney . European rival Airbus is focusing on so-called super jumbos, while Boeing is banking on smaller, slimmer planes such as the 787 Dreamliner . Analysts divided over which approach is best and say this latest tussle may prove to be a defining moment for the airline industry . Airbus overtook Boeing as the number one civilian planemaker in 2003, focusing on smaller planes and smaller aircraft over longer distances . Boeing said earnings during the last three months of 2004 dropped by 84% because of costs relating to stopping production of its smallest airliner, the 717, and the cancellation of a US air force 767 tanker contract in the same period in the quarter, compared with $1.13bn in the previous quarter of 2004
