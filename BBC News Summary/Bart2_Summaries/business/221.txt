 BP announces 26% rise in annual profits to $16.2bn (Â£8.7bn) on back of record oil prices . Company also increases fourth-quarter dividend by 26% to 8.5 cents . CEO Lord Browne says profits are up more than the price of oil is up . However, BP's share price rose 4p or nearly 1% in morning trading to 548p . Last week, rival Shell reported an annual profit of $17.5bn - a record profit for a UK-listed company . Lord Browne rejects calls for a windfall tax on his company's huge profits, saying in the North Sea it paid progressively more tax, the more profits it made . BP put production for the year at 3.997 billion barrels of oil, up 10% on 2003, but slightly lower than the four billion barrels it had initially aimed for.
