 Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML), British Bankers Association (BBA) and Building Societies Association all said mortgage lending was slowing . CML figures showed gross lending fell by 4% in November as the number of people buying new homes fell . The CML said that loans for new property purchases fell 25% year-on-year to 85,000 - the lowest total seen since February 2003 . The average asking price of a home fell by more than £600 from £190,329 in November to £189,733 in December . The length of time it takes to sell a home rose to 81 days from 53 in the summer, according to property website Rightmove . The figures come hot on the heels of new data from Rightmove which suggested owners must indulge in a "winter sale" and slash prices by up to 8% to cut prices by 8% in the market . Rightmove said estate agents set to enter 2005 with a third more properties on their books than a year ago
