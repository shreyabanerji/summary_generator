 New President, Viktor Yushchenko, has said a "limited" list of companies is being drawn up . Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko said the government was planning to renationalise 3,000 firms . Government says many privatised firms were sold to allies of the last administration at rock-bottom prices . More than 90,000 businesses in all, from massive corporations to tiny shopfronts, have been sold off since 1992 .
