 US budget deficit to hit $368bn (Â£197bn) this year, officials said on Tuesday . Past Congressional Budget Office forecasts said there would be a $348bn shortfall in 2005 fiscal year . In November, the gap between US exports and imports widened to more than $60bn, a record figure . Republicans have blamed the size of the deficit on slow economic conditions after the 11 September attacks and ongoing military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan . Democrats accuse the president of excluding Iraq-related costs from previous budgets to meet the aim of reducing the deficit, a charge which the administration denies . The CBO also forecast a total shortfall of $855bn for the years from 2006 to 2015, but analysts say the new figures fail to take into account the potential $2-$3.8 trillion costs of the president's plan to revamp state pensions and extend tax cuts . The figure could also be worsened by any further military costs, they said . The US administration asked Congress for additional funds for military operations .
