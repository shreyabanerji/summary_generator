 The economy has become the second-most dominant issue for many political parties ahead of Sunday's election . Some progress has been made, largely thanks to the country's oil revenues which have exceeded $22bn since June 2003 . Foreign firms also hope to cash in on the reconstruction effort . But the involvement of foreign firms in the health and banking sectors and beyond sits uneasily with many Iraqis who are accustomed to the state taking responsibility for functions that are essential to making society work, says Bristol University political scientist Anne Alexander, who is working on a project that looks at governance and security in post-war Iraq . "The rich get richer, the poor get poorer," says Radwan Hadi, deputy managing director of Aberdeen-based oil and gas consultancy Blackwatch Petroleum Services, which entered Iraq in 2003 . "I think the private sector will evolve incredibly fast," Mr Hadi says. "Iraq's vast natural resources can support any magnitude of economic growth," he says. But there are exceptions.
