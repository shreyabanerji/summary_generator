 Fed chief Alan Greenspan urges Congress to take action to cut the deficit . Pension and healthcare costs pose the greatest risks to the economy, he said . Government program faces severe financial strains in coming decades as baby-boom generation retires . Since President George W Bush came to office the federal budget has swung from a record surplus to a record deficit of $412bn last year . Despite dire warnings, Mr Greenspan did offer some good news for the short term as US growth gathers steam and incomes rise . Recent increases in defence and homeland security spending are also not expected to continue indefinitely, which should cut some costs . Meanwhile any move to narrow the deficit gap by raising taxes could pose a significant risk to the . economy by dampening growth and spending, he added. It is also expected to be less than expected to do in the long run of the next few years. It should also help reduce some costs in the short run of time, which is expected to cut some of the deficit.
