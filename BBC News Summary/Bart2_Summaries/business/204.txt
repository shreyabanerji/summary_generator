 President Bush to outline 'toughest' budget proposals to date to US Congress . About 150 programs could be cut or axed altogether as part of a $2.5 trillion (Â£1.3 trillion) package . Defence spending will rise, however, while the proposals exclude the cost of continuing military operations in Iraq . Vice-President Dick Cheney says the budget is the "tightest" so far in Bush's first term . The budget does not include the costs of running military campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan, for which the administration in expected to seek an extra $80bn from Congress later this year . The deficit is projected to rise to $427bn in 2005, with the deficit set to reach $230bn by 2009 . The proposals will be fiercely contested over the next few months . Some expects believe this could require borrowing of up to $4.5bn trillion over a twenty-year period . The proposal could mean borrowing for social security overhauling of social security provision would require borrowing .
