 Iran's parliament votes to cut Turkcell's stake in a new mobile network from 70% to 49% . The move was justified on national security grounds . If Turkcell does back out, South African firm may well be back in the running . It is the second Turkish-Austrian deal to run into trouble after TAV closed Tehran's new airport in 2004 . The hardline stance taken by parliament could yet impact other investments in Turkey and South Africa . In both cases, the decision has been justified by national security .
