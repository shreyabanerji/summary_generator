 Japan economy slides to recession for the fourth time in a decade . Government revised growth figures from earlier in 2004 effectively tips Japan into recession . Japan's economy grew 2.6% overall last year and is forecast to see growth of 2.1% in 2005 . Politicians remain upbeat about prospects for an economic boost later in the year . Analysts say the figures are disappointing but argue that Japan's largest companies had been recording healthy profits and capital spending was on the rise . Tokyo stock market fell after the figures were announced, but rose again on a widespread perception that the economy will recover later this year . The economy's fragile recovery remains dependent on an upturn in consumer spending, a fall in the value of the yen and an improvement in the global economies and a rise in global economies . The Japanese government takes other factors into account when judging the status of its economy. The Japanese economy is expected to recover later in 2005, say analysts. The latest figures were released by the government's Cabinet Office
