 Some 200 new jobs to be created at Oxford factory, including modernised machinery and a new body shell production building . The investment could be to raise output to more than 200,000 cars from 2007 . The rise is a response to rapidly-rising demand and could help wipe out waiting lists . Before Wednesday's announcement, BMW had invested some £280m in Mini production . The company admits that the success of the brand came despite scepticism from many in the industry . Last year, almost one in six cars sold by the BMW group was a Mini . The price of the car has also gone up from £10,000 to almost £11,500 to own a new Mini One, or even more for the Cooper S which costs up to £17,730 . The Mini Convertible, which was launched last spring, costs £15,690 for the top model, and there is even a waiting list. There are rumours that a new paint shop could also be included in the plans .
