 Watchdog probes Vivendi bond sale with French stock market regulator AMF . Watchdog believes the prospectus for a bond issue was unclear and that executives may have had privileged information . Vivendi has said it believes there is "no legal basis" for the complaints . The watchdog is also looking into whether the executives knew that Vivendi was considering exercising its right to buy British Telecom's shares in Cegetel . Back in December, Vivendi and its former chief executive Jean-Marie Messier were each fined 1m euros ($1.3m; Â£690,000)
