 Yukos drops banks from court bid to stop sale of its key oil unit . Yukos says sale was illegal and is pursuing damages in a US court . State-owned Rosneft bought the unit for $9.3bn (Â£5bn) after Yukos was forced to sell assets to meet a $27.5bn tax bill . But Yukos still has an outstanding complaint against Deutsche Bank, which it alleges to be the leader of a consortium that was behind a bid for Yugansk by Gazprom .
