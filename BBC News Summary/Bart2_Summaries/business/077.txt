 Russian state bank VEB lent state-owned Rosneft $6bn to help buy Yugansk, it has been revealed . The Kremlin said the $6billion loan came from Chinese banks . The revelation came as the Russian government said Rosnft had signed a long-term oil supply deal with China . The deal is seen as part of China's desire to secure long term oil supplies to feed its booming economy . Analysts said one factor might have influenced the Chinese decision was the possibility of litigation from Yukos, Yukos's former owner, if CNPC had become a shareholder . Yukos claims its downfall was punishment for the political ambitions of its founder Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who is now on trial for fraud and tax evasion . The Chinese are trying to get some leverage in Russia, says analyst Dmitry Lukashov, an analyst at brokerage Aton Aton.ęghghghshov.Ęghghtghtggtgtk.
