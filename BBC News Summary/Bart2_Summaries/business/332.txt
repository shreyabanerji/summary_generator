 Putin backs state grab for Yukos, saying it followed free market principles . Rosneft bought 100% of Baikal Finance Group, in a move that amounts to the renationalisation of a major chunk of Russia's booming oil industry . The Russian government put Yukos's Yuganskneftegas subsidiary up for sale last week after hitting the company with a $27bn (Â£14bn) bill for back taxes and fines . Yukos share jumped in Moscow, climbing as much as 50% before being suspended . The company accused Gazprom of illegally taking part in Sunday's auction . It has said it will be seeking damages of $20bn from Gazprom, which authorities have said will go ahead as planned . The latest announcement comes after more than a year of wrangling that has pushed Yukos to the brink of collapse . Analysts say that the saga still has a long way to go, but analysts reckon that it still has to go ahead with negotiations still to go .
