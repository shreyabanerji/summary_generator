 Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi will present an 'Action Plan for the Development of Italy' in a meeting with industrialists and trade union leaders . He is expected to table reforms aimed at boosting research and development (R&D) spending, and the competitiveness of small firms . Also in focus will be bankruptcy laws and the slow pace of the legal system . Italy has been one of the eurozone's worst economic performers in recent years . Growth was 1.1% in 2004, up from just 0.3% in 2003 and 0.4% in 2002 - still a long way from ideal . Italy plans to raise as much as 25bn euros from privatisations in 2005, including a partial flotation of the post office and utility Enel . Critics argue that these moves do not go far enough and could make Italy's economic problems worse and that they could make the country's problems worse . The government says that getting growth going was the responsibility of all of Italy's 60 million population
