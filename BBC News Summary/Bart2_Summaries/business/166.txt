 The Mail on Sunday says the UK Treasury has allocated Â£7.5bn for the project . The much delayed Crossrail Link Bill would provide for a fast cross-London rail link . The new line would go out as far as Maidenhead, Berkshire, to the west of London, and link Heathrow to Canary Wharf via the City . A spokesman for Crossrail said he could not confirm whether the Treasury was planning to invest . However, he said some impetus may have been provided by the proximity of an election .
