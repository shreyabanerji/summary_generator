 As much as 13.6% of loans made by private banks to clients in disaster zone has been written off or damaged . State-owned lenders may be even worse hit, Sri Lanka Banks Association says . Private banking sector has 25bn rupees ($250m; Â£135m) of loans outstanding in the disaster zone . Most banks are extending cheap loans for rebuilding and recovery, as well as giving clients more time to repay existing borrowing . The combination means a revenue shortfall during 2005, SLBA chairman - and Commercial Bank managing director - AL Gooneratne says .
