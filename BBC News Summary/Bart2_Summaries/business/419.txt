 Judy Boynton stepped down from her post in April 2004 after the firm over-stated its reserves . In January 2004 Shell told shocked investors that its reserves were 20% smaller than previously thought . In September Shell paid Â£82.7m in fines to regulators on both sides of the Atlantic for violating market rules in its reporting of its reserves, which led to the resignation of its chairman, Sir Phil Watts, and production chief Walter van der Vijver . An investigation commissioned by Shell found that Ms Boynton had to share responsibility for the company's behaviour .
