 Deutsche Bank says Yukos has few Texas ties beyond bank accounts and a Texas-based finance chief . Claims Yukos had artificially manufactured a legal case to stop the sale of its main asset . Deutsche Bank wanted to help fund Gazprom's plans for a $10bn (Â£5.18bn) bid for Yukos unit Yuganskneftegas .
