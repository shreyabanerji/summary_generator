 The government is trying to encourage saving at an early age, through its new Child Trust Fund . Parents and relatives will be able to top up the fund with up to Â£1,200 a year, which will grow free of income and capital gains tax . As the fund will not be in force in time for Christmas, relatives could invest their gifts in a higher rate children's deposit account, and use this as a feeder fund . There are accounts designed to start children off in the savings habit and they often pay higher rate of interest . Premium Bonds make great presents, with the promise of riches far greater than a mere deposit account . One way to spread the risk is to invest in the stock market through a unit or investment trust . Exchange Traded Funds offer an alternative way to track a stock market . The only drawback with all financial gifts is that the children gain the right to the money at age 18, and it may be that the parents will have no control over how it is spent .
