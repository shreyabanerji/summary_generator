 Bank of America has lost account details of more than one million US federal employees . The tapes went missing in December while being shipped to a back-up data centre . Several members of the US Senate are among those affected, who could now be vulnerable to identity theft . The bank gave no details of how the records disappeared, but said they had probably not been misused . The Secret Service is said to be looking into the loss of the tapes, which may have been stolen from a plane by baggage handlers, sources say . About 900,000 military and civilian staff at the defence department are among the 1.2 million affected, according to a Pentagon spokesman for the U.S. bank . Bank officials say account holders will be notified if any "unusual activity" is detected . Back to Mail Online Online home. Back to the page you came from: Share your story.
