 South Korea's economy has suffered from overhang of personal debt after consumers' credit card spending spree . Consumer confidence has bounced back from a four-year low in January, and retail sales were up 2.1% in December . Only one in 13 of the 48 million cards now in default - down from one in eight at the end of 2003 . Exports - traditionally the driver for expansion in Asian economies - grew slower in January than at any time in 17 months, but domestic demand seems to be taking up the slack .
