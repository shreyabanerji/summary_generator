 Emilio Botin is accused of misusing the bank's funds after he approved the payment of 160m euros ($208m; Â£111m) in bonus and pension payouts to two former executives . The trial was suspended after Mr Botin's lawyer introduced a new set of documents on the day testimony was set to begin . The bank's board of governors strongly reject the charges against their chairman, saying the payouts were legal and made with their unanimous support . If convicted, Botin could face a prison term of up to six years .
