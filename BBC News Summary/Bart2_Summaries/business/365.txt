 Nasdaq Stock Market plans to raise $100m (Â£52m) from the sale . Some observers see this as another step closer to a full public listing . Nasdaq first sold shares in private placements during 2000 and 2001 . It technically went public in 2002 when the stock started trading on the OTC Bulletin Board .
