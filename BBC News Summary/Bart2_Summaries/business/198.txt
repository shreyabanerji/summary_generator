 Cairn Energy's share price rose 300% last year after a number of oil finds, but its shares were hit in December following a disappointing drilling update . The company said it now believed the development area in Rajasthan would be able to produce oil for more than 25 years . The discovery was made after having been granted an extension to their drilling licence in January by Indian authorities . It is still in danger of being relegated from the FTSE 100 when the index is reshuffled next month .
