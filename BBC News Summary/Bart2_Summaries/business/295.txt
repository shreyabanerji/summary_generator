 Business confidence among Japanese manufacturers has weakened for the first time since March 2003 . Japan's economy grew by just 0.1% in the three months to September, according to the Bank of Japan . Big manufacturers were even more pessimistic about the first quarter of 2005 . Japanese firms reported they expect to invest 7.7% more in the year to March 2005 than the previous year - up from 6.1 percent in the September survey . China's attempts to cool down its fast-growing economy have also hit Japanese industry's sales abroad . The Tankan index is based on a survey of 10,227 firms. The survey is published by the Japan Economic Economic Council of Japan, Japan's Economic Council Department of Economics and Japan's National Research Institute for Economic Development Institute for the Economics and Institute for Science and Technology.
