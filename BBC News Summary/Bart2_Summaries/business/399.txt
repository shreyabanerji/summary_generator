 Indian oil firm eyes Yukos assets of troubled Russian crude producer Yukos . ONGC chairman Subir Raha: "We are in touch with the concerned Russian entities" Yukos forced to sell its key production unit Yuganskneftegas (Yugansk) last month after being hit with a bill of $27bn in unpaid taxes and fines . India's oil production has stagnated over recent years, and it is having to look abroad to secure future supplies . India imports about 70% of its total oil consumption, and the country's thirst for oil is so strong that it has pushed up the price of crude worldwide . China National Petroleum has also been mentioned as a possible investor, while Italy refused to rule out an interest in the oil producer in the deal . On Thursday, a U.S. court said it will hear arguments for Yukos' bankruptcy claim to be thrown out on 16 February . The dispute is partly driven by President Putin's clampdown on ex-Yukos
