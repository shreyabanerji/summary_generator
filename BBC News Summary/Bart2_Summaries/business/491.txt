 Indonesia 'declines debt freeze' offered by Paris Club group of creditors . Economics Minister says $1.7bn donors' aid package meant the debt freeze was unnecessary . The 19 member countries of the Paris Club are owed about $5bn this year in debt repayments by nations affected by the Indian Ocean tsunami . Indonesia, Sri Lanka and the Seychelles accepted the offer, which was criticised by some aid groups as being too little . Thailand and India have however declined the offer with Thailand prefering to keep up with its payments while India said it would prefer to rely on its own resources rather than on international aid . The Indonesian government has said it will announce monthly how much it has received in foreign donations and how it has spent the money in the past month to allay suspicion of official corruption in relief operations. The announcement should allay suspicions of official misconduct, according to an earlier version of this version of the above article on this article by CNN.com. Back to Mail Online
