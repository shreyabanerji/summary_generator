 Turkcell signed a contract for the new network in September . The new operator planned to offer subscriptions for about $180, well below the existing firm's $500 price tag . But a parliamentary commission has now ruled that Turkcell's 70% controlling stake is too high . They say Turkcell is a security risk because of alleged business ties with Israel . Iran currently has only one heavily congested mobile network, with long waiting lists for new subscribers . The firm has refused to comment on whether it has business dealings in Israel, although like almost all GSM operators worldwide it has an interconnection deal with Israeli networks so that its customers can use their phones there . The ruling would "make more difficult" Turkcell said the ruling would be reduced to less than 50% of the firm's stake would be cut to 50% in a statement. It said the realisation of the project will become risky. The ruling will be voted on on Tuesday by Iran's Parliament as a whole - dominated by religious conservatives
