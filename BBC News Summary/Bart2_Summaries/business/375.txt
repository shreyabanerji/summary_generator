 South Korea's largest credit card firm has averted liquidation following a one trillion won ($960m) bail-out . LG Card has seven million customers and its collapse would have sent shockwaves through the country's economy . The firm's creditors - which own 99% of LG Card - have been trying to agree a deal to secure its future for several weeks . They took control of the company in January when it avoided bankruptcy only through a $4.5bn bail out . The agreement will see some 12 trillion won of debt converted into equity .
