 US politicians and citizens of all political persuasions are in for a dose of shock therapy . Without major changes in current policies and political prejudices, the federal budget simply cannot hold together . The trigger for the coming shock will be rising federal debt, which will grow in 10 years, by conservative estimates to more than half the nation's total output . The biggest spending growth areas are defence (including homeland security), and health care for the elderly and the poor . The US Government cannot finance its operations without heavy borrowing from the central banks of Japan and China, among other nations . The decline of the dollar is a warning sign that current economic trends cannot continue. The dollar is already sinking, and the U.S. has two significant military missions. Borrowing for investments in education and infrastructure that pay off in future years makes sense. The sooner we face that reality, the sooner workable reforms can be pursued, says the Economic Policy Institute. There is no good reason to fixate on it, anyway
