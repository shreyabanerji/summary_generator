 Pensions Policy Institute said life expectancy for unskilled and professional men has been understated . Life expectancy at birth is 71 years for a manual worker and 79 years for professional . But if measured at age 65 instead, a professional worker will live to 81 years . The PPI's estimate is higher because it excludes people who have died before they reach 65 years of age . Government has ruled out raising the state pension age, because it says it would penalise lower-skilled workers who generally have lower life expectancies .
