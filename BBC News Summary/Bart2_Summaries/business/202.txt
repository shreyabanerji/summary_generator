 Verizon is set to pay an ""unconscionable, unfair and grossly inadequate" sum for MCI . The lawsuit was filed on Friday after Qwest Communications said it would submit an improved bid for the long-distance and corporate phone firm . Verizon's offer, made up of cash, shares and dividends, undervalued the company, the lawsuit argues . A takeover of MCI would be the fifth billion-dollar telecoms deal since October as companies look to cut costs and boost client bases . Earlier this month, SBC Communications agreed to buy its former parent and phone pioneer AT&T for about $16bn . In 2002, investors in the then-named Worldcom lost millions when the company filed for bankruptcy following an accounting scandal but the firm - now renamed MCI - has put its operations in order and emerged from bankruptcy protection last April . It is a long- distance and corporate mobile phone firm and would provide the buyer with access to a large number of business-based subscribers
