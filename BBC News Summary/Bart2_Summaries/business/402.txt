 US interest rates are expected to rise for the fifth time since June following the US Federal Reserve's latest rate-setting meeting later on Tuesday . Borrowing costs are tipped to rise by a quarter of a percentage point to 2.25% . The move comes as a recovery in the US economy shows signs of robustness and sustainability . The dollar's record-breaking decline, meanwhile, has spooked markets and along with high oil prices has raised concerns about the pace of inflation . The Fed has said that it will move in a "measured" way to combat price growth and lift interest rates from their 40-year lows that were prompted by sluggish US and global growth . However, analysts warn that Fed has to be careful not to move too aggressively and take the wind out of the recovery's sails . The US economy grew at an annual rate of 3.9% in the three months to September but job creation is still weak, while consumer confidence is subdued, according to recent figures .
