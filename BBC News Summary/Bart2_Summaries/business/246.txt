 Ex-finance chief Scott Sullivan says Bernie Ebbers was directly involved in the $11bn financial fraud at the firm . Mr Sullivan, WorldCom's former number two, is the government's chief witness in its case against Mr Ebbers . The former telecoms firm was forced into bankruptcy, the largest in US history . Ebbers has denied all the charges, saying he was unaware of the fraud . He could face a sentence of 85 years if convicted of all of the charges he is facing in New York state capital, the U.S. capital of $11billion fraud at telecoms giant WorldCom . Former WorldCom boss Ebbers built up the firm from a small regional operator into one of the largest telecoms firms in the country's history of American telecoms companies in the 1990s and 2000s. He denies all charges of conspiracy and fraud. His lawyers claim that their client was unfamiliar with detailed accounting practices and left that side of the business to Mr Sullivan to his own .
