 Unions claim Fiat is to close the Fiat Powertrain plant at Arese near Milan and instead source six-cylinder engines from General Motors . News comes a week after GM pulled out of an agreement to buy Fiat . All Alfa Romeo models can be bought with a six-crotter engine - the 147, 156, 156 Sportwagon, 166, GTV, GT and Spider . Fiat has yet to comment on the matter, but the new engines will be made by GM in Australia .
