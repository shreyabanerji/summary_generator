Many firms struggling to keep final salary schemes open, because of rising costs and increased liabilities . Rising cost of maintaining such schemes has led many employers to replace them with money purchase schemes . Some schemes in good health but firms have been forced to top up funds to tackle 'yawning deficits' Incomes Data Services' survey of 280 schemes by IDS said contributions had increased from £5.5bn to £8.2bn a year, a rise of 49.7% .
