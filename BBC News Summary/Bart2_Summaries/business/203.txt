 Hedge funds TCI and Atticus plan to demand removal of Deutsche Boerse chairman and CEO . Investors want Deutsche to return cash to shareholders rather than bid . Deutsche is in competition with Euronext to take over the London exchange . However, any such move would have to wait until May's annual general meeting, Reuters says . Deutsche does not need investor backing to make a takeover bid under German law, but would not need it to do so until March, the Office of Fair Trading says .
