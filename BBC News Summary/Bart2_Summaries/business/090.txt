 French wine industry hit by declining consumption at home and growing popularity of New World wines . The bulk of the money - about 40m euros - will be offered in the form of preferential loans to heavily indebted producers . A further 15m euros will be made available to wine cooperatives in low interest loans . Efforts to promote French wine abroad are to be boosted by an extra 3.5m euros in funding . France fell behind the 'New World' producers of Australia, Chile and the U.S. for the first time in 2003 in terms of exports . The support is designed to make French producers more competitive in the face of increasing global consolidation across the wine industry . But wine makers and farmers said the support was much less than they had been hoping for. "I am afraid the resources are not up to the ambitions," said Jean-Michel Lemetayer, from the FNSEA agricultural union, for the Associated Press news agency . The government will also seek EU approval to distil about 250 million litres of excess wine into alcohol
