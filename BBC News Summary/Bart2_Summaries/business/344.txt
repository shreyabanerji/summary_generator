 Dollar hits record low against euro at $1.3516 in thin New York trade . France's finance minister says world faces 'economic catastrophe' if US doesn't work with Europe and Asia on currency controls . Year-on-year sales of new homes in the US had fallen 12% in November . Consumer spending - which drives two thirds of the US economy - grew just 0.2% last month . The dollar has now fallen for a third consecutive year and analysts are forecasting a further weakening of the dollar in 2005 . The US says it will let market forces determine the dollar's strength rather than intervene directly . The official US policy is that it supports a strong dollar but many market observers believe it is happy to let the dollar fall because of the boost to its exporters. The US government has faced pressure from exporter organisations which have publicly stated the currency still has further to fall from 'abnormal and dangerous heights" set in 2002. The U.S. says it won't intervene
