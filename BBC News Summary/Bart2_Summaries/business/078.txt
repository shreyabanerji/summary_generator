 Fiat and General Motors have until midnight on 1 February to settle a disagreement over a potential takeover deal . Deal is part of an alliance agreed in 2000 between GM and DaimlerChrysler . GM is thought to be offering about $2bn (Â£1.06bn) to extricate itself from the deal . Reports of deadlocked talks sent Fiat shares down 1.2% on Tuesday, after Monday's 4% gain on hopes of a payoff . GM's own European operations are losing money, and Opel and Saab have both had trouble .
