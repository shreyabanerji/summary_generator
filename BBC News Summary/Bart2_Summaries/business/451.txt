 Winemaker rejects Foster's offer worth 3.1bn Australian dollars ($2.3bn; Â£1.8bn) from brewing giant Foster's Group . Foster's bought an 18.8% stake in Southcorp from the Oatley family, which founded the Rosemount Estates business and later merged it into SouthCorp . A merger would create a global player with worldwide annual sales of 39m cases and revenues of A$2.6bn . The offer may represent an 'opening bid', opening up the possibility of Foster's returning with an improved offer .
