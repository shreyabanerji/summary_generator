 The International Energy Agency (IEA) warned demand for Opec's crude in the first quarter would outstrip supply . US light crude rose $1.64 to $47.10, while Brent crude in London gained $44.45 . The fresh rally in crude prices followed gains on Wednesday which were triggered by large falls in US crude supplies following a cold spell in North America in January . The US Department of Energy reported that crude stockpiles had fallen 1m barrels to 294.3m .
