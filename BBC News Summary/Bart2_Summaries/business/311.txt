 Swiss Re said it had registered about 300 natural and man-made disasters around the world in 2004 . 95% of insurance claims were for natural catastrophes, with the rest attributed to made-made events . The largest claims came from the US, which was hit by four hurricanes, and Japan, which suffered the highest concentration of typhoons for decades plus a major earthquake . The damages claimed in 2004 eclipsed previous years, including 2001 when the 11 September attacks pushed claims up to $37bn .
