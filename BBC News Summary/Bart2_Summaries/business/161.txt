 Ex-Boeing director gets jail term and fine of $250,000 (Â£131,961) for illegally hiring Air Force aide . Michael Sears admitted his guilt in breaking conflict of interest laws by recruiting Darleen Druyun while she still handled military contracts . She is currently serving a nine month sentence for favouring Boeing when awarding lucrative contracts . Boeing lost a $23bn government contract after a Pentagon inquiry into the case . The Pentagon revealed earlier this week that it would examine eight other contracts worth $3bn which it believes may have been tainted by her role in the procurement process . Boeing's corporate ethics have come under scrutiny on several occasions in recent years . Boeing was sued by Lockheed Martin after its rival accused it of industrial espionage during a 1998 contract competition in the 1998 contract dispute . However, analysts believe Boeing may yet face civil charges arising from the scandal. The Pentagon has investigated 400 contracts, dating back to 1993, since the allegations against Ms DruyUN came to light .
