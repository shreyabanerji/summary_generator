 EU-US seeking deal on air dispute between Airbus and Boeing . Both sides hope to reach a negotiated deal over state aid received by European aircraft maker Airbus and its US rival Boeing . Last year, the US terminated an agreement with the EU, reached in 1992, which limits the subsidies countries can hand over to civil aircraft makers . Airbus overtook Boeing as the world's largest manufacturer of commercial airliners in 2003 . The US filed a complaint against Brussels with the WTO over Airbus, prompting a retaliatory EU complaint over US support for Boeing . EU Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson: "I hope our negotiations in the next three months will lead to an agreement ending subsidies to development and production of large civil aircraft" U.S. firm UPS says it has placed an order for 10 Airbus A380 superjumbo freight-carrying jets, with an option to buy 10 more of the triple-decker aircraft, with 10 more planes to be bought by the U.EADS and BAE Systems
