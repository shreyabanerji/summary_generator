 Mortgage lending rose by £7.1bn in December, up from a £6.4bn rise in November . Figures contradict a survey from the British Bankers' Association, which said approvals were at a five-year low . Analysts say the figures show the market may be stabilising but still point to further house price softness . New rules came into force in October last year, which meant some lenders were forced to withdraw mortgage products temporarily in November and defer some lending until they had made sure they had complied with the rules properly .
