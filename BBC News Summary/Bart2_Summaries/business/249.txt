 $2.58 trillion (Â£1.38 trillion) budget submitted to Congress . Budget does not include cost of running military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan . Military spending is set to rise by 4.8%, to reach $419.3bn . Budget is still the tightest yet under George W Bush's presidency . Key spending line missing from proposals is the cost of overhaul of Social Security . Some experts believe this could require borrowing of up to $4.5 trillion over a 20-year period . Bush has promised to halve the US's massive budget deficit within five years, but the deficit could shrink to little more than $200bn by 2009, returning to the surpluses seen in the late 1990s by 2012, according to the independent Congressional Budget Office .
