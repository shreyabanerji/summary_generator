 Spending on credit and debit cards overtakes cash spending in the UK for the first time . The switch over took place at 10.38am on Wednesday in Tesco's Cromwell Road branch . The Association for Payment Clearing Services (Apacs) chose school teacher Helen Carroll, from Portsmouth, to make the historic transaction . Shoppers expected to put £269bn on plastic cards during the whole of 2004, compared with £268bn paid with cash . When the first plastic cards appeared in June 1966, issued by Barclaycard, only a handful of retailers accepted them .
