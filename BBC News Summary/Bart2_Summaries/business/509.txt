 More than 90% of large companies around the world are highly optimistic about their economic prospects . Firms in Western Europe - but not the UK - are lacking confidence after years of slow growth . Biggest worries are over-regulation, low-cost competition and the wild ups and downs of oil prices . The rapid decline of the US dollar is not seen as a huge threat anymore, unlike even a year ago, when it was cited as the third-largest problem .

The survey was carried out by PricewaterhouseCoopers .
