 German bidder in talks with LSE after initial Â£1.3bn offer rejected by LSE . Euronext may be prepared to make offer in cash ahead of Friday talks . Neither side has made a formal offer for the LSE, with sources claiming such a step may still be weeks away . A deal with either bidder would create the biggest stock market operator in Europe and the second biggest in the world after the New York Stock Exchange . Local government officials in Frankfurt's state of Hessen have spoken out against a move to the UK to maintain Frankfurt's standing as the number one financial centre in continental Europe, its minister for economic affairs said . Deutsche Boerse could also face mounting opposition to a bid at home . But the Bundesbank said that cash trading should also remain in Frankfurt, something Deutsche Boers could move to Britain .
