 Budget airline Ryanair has placed an order for 70 Boeing 737-800 planes . The deal is worth $4bn (Â£2.1bn) and will lead to 2,500 new Ryanair jobs . Ryanair said the new planes would help it to cut operating costs further . The airline said that when all these planes have been delivered, it will be able to carry more than 70 million passengers a year, making it Europe's largest airline . The order can be seen as good news for Boeing, which in recent years has been overtaken by European plane maker Airbus .
