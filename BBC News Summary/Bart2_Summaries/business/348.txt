 US to probe airline travel chaos after travel chaos over the Christmas weekend . 30,000 passengers stranded and 10,000 pieces of baggage undelivered . US Airways is in bankruptcy protection for the second time in two years . Comair's computer breakdown plunged its flight-crew scheduling system into disarray . Airline is trying to negotiate pay cuts with flight and baggage staff, and is looking for pay cuts totalling $800m . The probe will focus on compliance with a 1999 agreement aimed at improving the quality of passenger service that has so far allowed airlines to avoid congressionally-mandated standards . Analysts say the Christmas chaos cast doubt on US Airway's ability to emerge from bankruptcy - and is likely to worsen the finances of troubled Delta, parent of Comair . The airline said it was "embarrassed by the situation" and "deeply regrets any inconvenience caused to customers" The investigation will also focus on the 1999 agreement that allows airlines to be more aggressive in improving passenger service
