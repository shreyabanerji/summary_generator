 Qantas could transfer 7,000 jobs out of its home country as it seeks to save costs . Chief executive Geoff Dixon said the carrier could no longer afford to remain "all-Australian" Unions criticised the possible move, saying Qentas was profitable and should not need to take such action . The airline said it would continue to create jobs in Australia but stressed this would not result in redundancies in its home market, where most of its 35,000 staff are based in Australia . The Australian newspaper quoted Geoff Dixon as saying it was looking at whether it might recruit and source products overseas - potentially through joint ventures - but said it will continue to build its operations in the Australian market . The carrier made a record Australian dollars 648m ($492m) profit last year, according to the newspaper . In an effort to meet the challenge posed by low cost carriers, Air New Zealand Airline said last year it sought a tie-up with Air New New Zealander last year .
