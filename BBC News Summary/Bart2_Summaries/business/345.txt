 World Bank president James Wolfensohn says agency is "only beginning to grasp the magnitude of the disaster" Sri Lanka, Thailand, India and Indonesia worst hit, with at least 25,000 dead . Governments expected to take steps, such as cutting taxes and increasing spending, to facilitate a recovery . Economic impact of tsunami and floods expected to be large, but not enough to derail the region's momentum in 2005, says World Bank chief . India's economy is less likely to slow because the areas hit are some of the least developed . Sri Lanka's tourist industry is likely to be hardest hit, while Thailand's fishing and real estate sectors also will be affected by Sunday's 9.0 magnitude earthquake . Malaysia said as many as 1,000 fishermen will also be affected and that damage to the industry will be ‘significant’ to its fishing and property industry will not be “significant” in the region. Analysts predict Sri Lanka’s tourist industry will struggle to recovery quickly .
