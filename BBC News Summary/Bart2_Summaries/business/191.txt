 US regulator to rule on pain drug that has been linked to high risk of heart attack and stroke . FDA has been asked to decide if the benefits justify the increased risks . The painkillers - called COX-2 inhibitors - are sold under brand names such as Celebrex and Vioxx . Merck voluntarily stopped sales of the painkillers in September . European regulators have ruled on Thursday that patients who have had heart disease or a stroke should not take Cox-2 inhibitor drugs . The European Medicines Agency also said doctors should be "cautious" about giving the drugs to patients with risk factors for heart disease . The FDA said on Tuesday that it will create an independent body to oversee the safety of drugs already in the market place .
