 GSK aims to stop Aids profiteers diverting cheaper pills back into Europe for resale at far higher price . The company, GlaxoSmithKline, is to alter the packaging and change the colour of the pills . It is estimated that drugs companies are losing hundreds of millions of dollars each year as a result of the diversion of their products in this way . GSK says distribution of the new-look drugs has already begun and that their chemical content is identical to those currently being sold in Europe .
