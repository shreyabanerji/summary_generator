 Sergio Marchionne replaces Herbert Demel as chief executive of Fiat Auto . Fiat underperformed the market in Europe last year, seeing flat sales . The car business has made an operating loss in five of the last six years . Fiat is to integrate the Maserati car company - currently owned by Ferrari - within its own operations . Ferrari, in which Fiat owns a majority stake, could be separately floated on the stock market in either 2006 or 2007 . The company is expected to make a 800m euro ($1bn) loss in 2004 - but sales are expected to fall in 2005, Fiat said this week, as it exits unprofitable areas such as the rental car market . Mr Demel, a car industry veteran, took the helm in November 2003 after being recruited by former Fiat chief executive Giuseppe Morchio . Mr Morchio made a bid last year to become chairman after the death of president Umberto Agnelli, but was rejected by the founding Anelli family
