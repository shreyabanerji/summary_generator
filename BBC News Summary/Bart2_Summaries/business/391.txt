 Yukos is due in a US court on Thursday as it continues to fight for its survival . The firm is in the process of being broken up by Russian authorities in order to pay a $27bn (Â£14bn) tax bill . Yukos filed for bankruptcy in the US, hoping to use international business law to halt the forced sale of its key oil production unit, Yuganskneftegas . The unit was however sold for $9.4bn to state oil firm Rosneft but only after the state auction had been disrupted . The company wants damages of $20bn, claiming the sale was sold at less than market value . Deutsche Bank, which is also an advisor to Gazprom, has called on the US court to overturn its decision to provide Yukos with bankruptcy protection . The dispute with the Russian authorities is partly driven by President Putin's clampdown on the political ambitions of ex-Yukos boss Mikhail Khodorkovsky is in jail on charges of fraud and
