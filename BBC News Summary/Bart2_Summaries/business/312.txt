 Parmalat has sued 45 banks as it tries to reclaim money paid to banks before the scandal-hit Italian dairy company went bust last year . The firm collapsed with debts of about 14bn euros ($19bn; Â£10bn) and new boss Enrico Bondi has already taken legal action against a number of lenders . He claims the banks were aware of the problems but continued to work with the company so they could earn commissions . Under Italian law, administrators can seek to get back money if there is a suspicion that the institutions knew that the company was in financial trouble .
