 Malcolm Glazer presented the board with detailed proposals on an offer to buy the football club earlier this month . The club said it would allow Mr Glazer "limited due diligence" to give him the opportunity to take the proposal on to a formal bid . But it said it continued to oppose the US tycoon's plans, calling his assumptions "aggressive" and his plan "damaging" Many of Manchester United's supporters own shares in the club, and the fan-based group Shareholders United is strongly opposed to any takeover . Manchester City has pleaded with visiting fans not to protest inside its ground when the two teams play a televised match on Sunday . Manchester United shares closed at 270.25p on Friday, down 3.75p on the day. The offer values the club at Â£800m ($1.5bn) The offer was pitched at 300p per share, but it also relies less on debt to finance it than an earlier approach from U.S. billionaire Glazer .
