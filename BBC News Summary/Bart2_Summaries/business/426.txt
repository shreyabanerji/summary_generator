 Economy minister German Gref says direct state involvement in oil was 'unjustified' Comments follow sale of much of oil giant Yukos to cover back taxes . Yukos sale effectively took most of firm's assets into public ownership . Gref is a well-known opponent of nationalisation in competitive parts of the market . He also poured cold water on President Putin's promises of doubled economic growth within a decade . The assault on Yukos' assets has been widely blamed for a slowdown in economic growth in recent months, with many blaming it for the slowdown in GDP growth in Russia's economy . The government needs to get out of oil, Mr Gref told Kommersant, adding: "Today our government is ineffective and state companies, as a result, are for the overwhelming part ineffective as well" He also said that Russia needed to improve its structure and not simply to increase GDP, but to improve people's lives. Instead of focusing on headline growth figures, Russia needs to focus on better institutions,
