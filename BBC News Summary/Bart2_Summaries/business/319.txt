 European stock market Euronext has approached the London Stock Exchange about a possible takeover bid . LSE rejected a Â£1.3bn ($2.5bn) takeover offer from Deutsche Boerse last week . The LSE saw its shares surge 4.9% to a new high of 583p in early trade on Monday . Experts now widely expect a bidding war for Europe's biggest stock market to break out . An attempted takeover of the LSE failed in 2000 after an attempted merger with Deerboerse failed, experts say . The group rejected the offer last week, claiming it undervalued the business . It said it could not guarantee a firm offer would be made for LSE at the time of the approach . The offer follows widespread media speculation that Euronex would make an offer for the company.. The company's share price has risen to 533p a share on Monday, according to the report. The report said that the offer would not be accepted by LSE
