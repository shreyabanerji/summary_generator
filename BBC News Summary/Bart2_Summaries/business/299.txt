 Russian oil firm has filed for bankruptcy protection in the US in an attempt to halt the forced sale of its main production arm . Russian prosecutors are forcing the sale of the firm's most lucrative asset Yuganskneftegas to help pay a $27bn (Â£14bn) back tax bill, which they claim is owed by Yukos . Russian authorities are due to auction off the unit on 19 December to pay a huge tax bill sent to the oil giant . Yukos says the forced auction is illegal and will cause the company to suffer "immediate and irreparable harm" The company also made a claim for damages against the Russian government . Analysts believe that if its production unit is auctioned off, it is likely to be bought up by a government-backed firm, like Gazprom, effectively bringing a large chunk of Russia's lucrative oil and gas industry back under state control . Many commentators believe the government's aggressive pursuit of Yukos is a politically-motivated response to Mikhail Khodorkovsky
