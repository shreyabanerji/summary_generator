 Rosneft bought the Yugansk unit for $9.3bn in a sale forced by Russia to part settle a $27.5bn tax claim against Yukos . Yukos' owner Menatep Group says it will ask the buyer of the unit to repay a loan that Yugansk secured on its assets . Legal experts say the purchase of the Russian oil giant's former production unit would include such obligations . Rosnef already faces a similar $540m repayment demand from foreign banks .
