 Yukos made its surprise bankruptcy filing in Houston in December . It was in an attempt to halt the auction of its main oil producing unit, Yugansk . Yukos says a US court was entitled to declare it bankrupt before the sale of the unit . The US court's jurisdiction has been challenged by Deutsche Bank and Gazpromneft . Deutsche Bank maintains the case has no place in the US because Yukos has no assets in the country, apart from two bank accounts and a house in Houston owned by its chief finance officer . The company is seeking $20bn in a separate US lawsuit against Rosneft and its former owner Mihkail Khodorkovsky, who is facing a 10-year prison term in Russia for fraud and tax evasion, for their role in the Yugansk sale . The case is expected to be heard by a US bankruptcy judge next Tuesday . Back to Mail Online home: click here for more information about the Yukos case. Back to the page you came from .
