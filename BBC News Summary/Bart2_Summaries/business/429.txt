 The US trade deficit was $55.5bn (Â£29bn), up 9% from September, the Commerce Department said . A weaker dollar also increased the cost of imports, though this should help drive export demand in coming months . The US imported almost $20bn worth of goods from China during October, exporting a little under $3bn . The figures caused the dollar to weaken further despite widespread expectations that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates for a fifth time this year . Borrowing costs are tipped to rise by a quarter of a percentage point to 2.25% at a Fed meeting later on Tuesday .
