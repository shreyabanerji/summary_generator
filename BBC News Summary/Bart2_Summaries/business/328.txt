 US budget and trade deficit are both deep in the red, fuelling fears about the economy . George W Bush indicated there would be "strict discipline" on non-defence spending in the budget . The US budget deficit hit a record $412bn (Â£211.6bn) in the 12 months to 30 September . The dollar's weakness has hit European and Asian exporters and lead to calls for US intervention to boost the currency . Mr Bush said the best way to halt the dollar's slide is to deal with the US deficit .
