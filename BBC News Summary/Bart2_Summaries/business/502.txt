 Price of butane gas has risen to 200 dinars ($2.77) per canister from 170 dinars . Butane gas and fuel oil are used as the main source of fuel to heat homes and cook food in Algeria's remote mountain areas . Riots also flared up in the Maghnia region close to the border with Morocco in the west, AFP said . The price of gas has been hit hard by failing economic conditions in some of Algeria's poorest regions before the hike .
