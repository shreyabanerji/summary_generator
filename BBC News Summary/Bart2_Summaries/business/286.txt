 China's economy has expanded by a breakneck 9.5% in 2004, well above 2003's 9.1% growth . But industrial growth has slowed, with services providing much of the impetus . China raised rates by 0.27 percentage points to 5.8% - its first hike in nine years - in October 2004 . China has sucked in raw materials and energy to feed its expansion, which could have knock-on effects on the rest of the world if it overheats . Still, consumer prices - at 2.4% - rose faster than in 2004 and investment in fixed assets was still high, up 21.3% from the previous year - although some way off the peak of 43% seen in the first quarter of 2004 . Despite the apparent rebalancing of the economy the overall growth picture remains strong, economists said. "There is no sign of a slowdown in 2005," said Tim Congdon, economist at ING Barings.
