 More than 2,000 business and political leaders from around the globe are arriving in the Swiss mountain resort for the annual World Economic Forum (WEF) They will discuss issues ranging from China's economic power to Iraq's future after this Sunday's elections . Unlike previous years, protests against the WEF are expected to be muted . Anti-globalisation campaigners have called off a demonstration planned for the weekend . The Brazilian city of Porto Alegre will host the rival World Social Forum, timed to run in parallel with Davos's ritzier event in Davos, to set an alternative agenda to that of the Swiss summit . The forum will be dominated by business issues - from outsourcing to corporate leadership - with bosses of more than a fifth of the world's 500 largest companies scheduled to attend . But much of the media focus will be on the political leaders coming to Davos . The WEF participants are being asked to offset the carbon emissions they cause by travelling to the event at Davos itself
