 US seeks new $280bn smoker ruling from tobacco firms . Court room battle is seen as key in government attempts to fight smoking . Three-judge appeal court panel rejected the claim - filed in 1999 by the Clinton administration - in a 2-1 decision . The tobacco companies deny the charges, saying they never illegally conspired to promote smoking and fool the public . They also said that they have met many of the government's demands laid out in a landmark $206bn settlement in 1998 with 46 states . Government lawyers have until 21 March to file their appeal against the decision, which is expected to be made by the full US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia in D.C. The court room battle will be heard later this month . Back to Mail Online home: Back to the page you came from.com/dailymailonline.
