 Office for National Statistics said it had been measuring road expenditure data wrongly over the past five years . Review by the ONS found it had made a mistake by "double counting" some spending on roads since 1998/9 . Correcting the error would mean reducing current expenditure and increasing net investment, thus helping Mr Brown to meet his "golden rule" of borrowing only to invest over the economic cycle . Shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin said: "At best the timing of these changes is very convenient for the government" The Conservatives said Mr Brown would still be forced to raise taxes after the general election to fill an annual Â£10.5bn "black hole" in the nation's coffers . But the Treasury said there would be no relaxation of economic discipline and the golden rule would be met even without the data revisions . Economists speculated that it might also allow for some vote-catching measures in the Budget . The IFS said there could also be a proportionate boost to the current budget in 2004/05
