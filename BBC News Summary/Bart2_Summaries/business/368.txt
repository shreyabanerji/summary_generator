 Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) is £23bn (£12m) in deficit . Financial Economists Roundtable (FER) wants Congress to change the PBGC's funding rules . FER says firms should not have been allowed to reduce the insurance premiums they pay into the pension fund . The FER blames this on a 2004 law, in a statement signed by several members of the FER . The PBGC was founded in 1974 to protect workers' retirement rights . Its most recent action came last week when it took control of the pilots' pension scheme at United Airlines .
