 Ten former directors at WorldCom agree to pay $54m (Â£28.85m) to settle class action lawsuit, reports say . Lawyer representing one of the directors said the 10 had agreed to pay those who lost billions when the firm collapsed . The remaining $36m will be paid by the directors' insurers . A formal agreement on the payout is expected to be signed on Thursday in a US district court in Manhattan . The second-largest US long-distance telecoms operator filed for bankruptcy in 2002 when an $11bn accounting scandal was unearthed . Former WorldCom chief executive Bernard Ebbers is to face trial this month on criminal charges that he oversaw the fraud . The settlement "sends a pretty strong shockwave through the director world", says a corporate governance expert . Two other outside former directors, Bert Roberts and Francesco Galesi, remain defendants in the lawsuit, according to the Wall Street Journal, said the WSJ report . The company emerged from Chapter 11 protection last year
