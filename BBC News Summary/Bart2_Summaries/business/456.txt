 Gazprom faces 1bn rouble ($35.7m; Â£19.1m) back-tax claim for 2001-2003 period . Most of the taxes claimed are linked to the company's export activity . Gazprom took over nuclear fuel giant Atomstroieksport in October 2004 . It is one of the key players in the complex Russian energy market, where the government has made moves to regain state influence over the sector . Some analysts fear the Kremlin will continue to use these sort of moves to boost efforts of the state to regain control over strategically important sectors such as oil .
