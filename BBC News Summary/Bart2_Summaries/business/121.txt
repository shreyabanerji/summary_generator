 Federal Reserve has raised its key federal funds rate by a quarter percentage point to 2% in light of mounting evidence that the US economy is regaining steam . Analysts say a clear-cut victory for President Bush in last week's election paved the way for a rise . The Dow Jones Industrial average closed down 0.89 points, or 0.01%, at 10,385.48 . Further rise in US rates unlikely to have a direct bearing on UK monetary policy . The Bank of England has kept interest rates on hold at 4.75% for the past three months, leading some commentators to argue that rates may have peaked . The BoE governor Mervyn King warned only last month that the era of consistently low inflation and low unemployment may be coming to an end last month . The further rise in U.S. rates is unlikely to be directly affected by the BoEâ€™s decision to keep interest rates at the same level in the Bank of English monetary policy in the UK
