 Yukos seeks court action on sale of its main oil production unit . Yukos will sue Baikal and others involved in the sale of Yuganskneftegas for $20bn in damages . Russian government forced sale of Yukos' most lucrative asset as part of its action to enforce a $27bn back tax bill it says the company owes . The future ownership of the unit remains unclear amid widespread suggestions that it was established as a front for other interests . President Putin suggested that China's National Petroleum Corporation could play a role in the unit's future after signing a commercial agreement with Gazprom to work on joint energy projects with the state-run oil giant Surgutnefga . The unit produces 60% of the company's oil output. Yukos has claimed that the sale will lead to the collapse of the group. It has claimed the sale is a government campaign to destroy it because of its founder, Mikhail Khodorkovsky's political ambitions of its former owner,
