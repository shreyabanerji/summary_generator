 US trade deficit widens sharply to more than $60bn (Â£31.7bn), an all-time record . Exports down 2.3% to $95.6bn, while imports up 1.3%. Part of the expanding deficit came from high prices for oil imports . But the numbers suggest the sliding dollar - which makes exports less expensive - has had little impact, and could indicate slowing economic growth . Treasury Secretary John Snow put a brave face on the news, saying it was a sign of strong economic expansion . The deficit with Japan was at its worst in more than four years, but the deficit with China was a slight decline in trade with the country . The White House has tacitly indicated that it would be happy if the slide continued . The dollar has fallen by 50% against the euro - as well as by 30% against Japan in the past three years - in the last three years. The US has also fallen by 30 per cent against the yen in three years
