UK 'risks breaking golden rule'

The UK government will have to raise taxes or rein in spending if it wants to avoid breaking its "golden rule", a report suggests. According to NIESR, if the government's current economic cycle runs until March 2006 then it is "unlikely" the golden rule will be met. Either way, fiscal tightening is needed, NIESR said. Earlier this month, accountancy firm Ernst & Young said that Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown's forecasts for tax revenues were too optimistic. GDP is expected at 3.2% in 2004, and 2.8% in both 2005 and 2006.
