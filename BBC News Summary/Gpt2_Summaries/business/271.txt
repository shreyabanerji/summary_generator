Arsenal 'may seek full share listing'

Arsenal vice-chairman David Dein has said the club may consider seeking a full listing for its shares on the London Stock Exchange. When Arsenal moves to its new stadium it will see its proportion of turnover from media earnings drop from 52% this season to 34% in two years' time. Television has been the driving force over the past 10 years... but we must constantly improve if we want to remain as the world's leading league competition. " We have got a very good product, so it is very important we go and look at these markets, and make sure we are on the case."
