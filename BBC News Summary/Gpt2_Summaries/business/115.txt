Glaxo aims high after profit fall

GlaxoSmithKline saw its profits fall 9% last year to Â£6.2bn ($11.5bn), but Europe's biggest drugmaker says a recovery during 2005 is on the way. Cheap copies of its drugs, particularly anti-depressants Paxil and Wellbutrin, and a weak dollar had hit profits, but global sales were up 1% in 2004. However, the firm discontinued development of an experimental treatment for obesity, known as '771, after disappointing clinical trial results.
