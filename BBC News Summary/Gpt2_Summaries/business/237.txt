Britannia members' £42m windfall

More than 800,000 Britannia Building Society members are to receive a profit share worth on average £52 each. Britannia has also stopped making payments to members if they are worth less than £5. To qualify for the profit share, members must have either a mortgage, or an investment account other than a deposit account.
