Shares rise on new Man Utd offer

Shares in Manchester United closed up 4.75% on Monday following a new offer from US tycoon Malcolm Glazer. I can't see any difference (compared to Mr Glazer's previous proposals) other than Â£200m less debt. " A proposal was received by David Gill, United's chief executive, at the end of last week, pitched at about 300p a share. David Cummings, head of UK equities for Standard Life Investments, said he believed a "well funded" 300p a share bid would be enough for Mr Glazer to take control of the club. They may not want him but they are going to get him." Mr Glazer and his family hold a stake of 28.1%.
