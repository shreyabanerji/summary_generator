German jobless rate at new record

More than 5.2 million Germans were out of work in February, new figures show. The news comes as the head of Germany's panel of government economic advisers predicted growth would again stagnate. Still, some measures suggest the picture is not quite so bleak. Using the most internationally-accepted methodology of the International Labour Organisation (ILO), Germany had 3.97 million people out of work in January.
