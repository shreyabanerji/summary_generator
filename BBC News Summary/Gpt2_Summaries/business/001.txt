Ad sales boost Time Warner profit

Quarterly profits at US media giant TimeWarner jumped 76% to $1.13bn (Â£600m) for the three months to December, from $639m year-earlier. TimeWarner said fourth quarter sales rose 2% to $11.1bn from $10.9bn. However, the company said AOL's underlying profit before exceptional items rose 8% on the back of stronger internet advertising revenues. TimeWarner is to restate its accounts as part of efforts to resolve an inquiry into AOL by US market regulators.
