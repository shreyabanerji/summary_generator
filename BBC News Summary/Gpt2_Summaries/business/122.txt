US bank in $515m SEC settlement

Five Bank of America subsidiaries have agreed to pay a total of $515m (Â£277m) to settle an investigation into fraudulent trading share practices. Three other ex-Columbia executives agreed settlements with the SEC. It was made up of $250m to pay back gains from market timing, and $125m in penalties. Separately, the SEC said it had reached a $140m deal - equally split between penalties and compensation - in its probe into Columbia Management Advisors (CAM) and Columbia Funds Distributor (CFD) and three ex-Columbia executives.
