Executive trio leave Aer Lingus

Three senior executives of Ireland's state-owned airline, Aer Lingus, are set to leave early on 28 January after accusations of a conflict of interest. That decision had followed an announcement by Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern - who is still considering the future of the airline - which ruled out a proposed management buy-out of Aer Lingus. I've been completely focused on my responsibilities at Aer Lingus," he told AP. Last Friday the minister had announced he was to advertise for three senior executives for Aer Lingus.
