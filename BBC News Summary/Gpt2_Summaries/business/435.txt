Fosters buys stake in winemaker

Australian brewer Fosters has bought a large stake in Australian winemaker Southcorp, sparking rumours of a possible takeover. "People will scratching their heads over this one. It seized the top spot when it bought Australian firm BRL Hardy for just over $1bn in 2003. However, Matt Williams, a fund manager at Perpetual Trustees said taking the stake "is definitely a precursor to a takeover".
