Wall Street cheers Bush victory

The US stock market has closed higher in response to George W Bush's victory in the presidential elections. Many investors believe that Mr Bush's policies are more business-friendly than those of his Democrat challenger, John Kerry. The Dow lost 5% of its value in the three weeks immediately after that election, when it was unclear who would occupy the White House. Elsewhere in the financial markets on Wednesday, the dollar dipped slightly against the euro and climbed against the yen, while US oil prices closed up $1.26 at $50.88 a barrel in New York. Share prices in London, Frankfurt and Paris also closed higher.
