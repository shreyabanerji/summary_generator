Ebbers 'aware' of WorldCom fraud

Former WorldCom boss Bernie Ebbers was directly involved in the $11bn financial fraud at the firm, his closest associate has told a US court. Mr Sullivan, 42, pleaded guilty to fraud last year and agreed to assist the government with its case against Mr Ebbers. On his first day of questioning, Mr Sullivan admitted to falsifying the company's financial statements. We did not talk about these adjustments and the information was false."
