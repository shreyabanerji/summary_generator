Asian banks halt dollar's slide

The dollar regained some lost ground against most major currencies on Wednesday after South Korea and Japan denied they were planning a sell-off. The dollar was buying 104.76 yen at 0950 GMT, 0.5% stronger on the day. The focus has been on the country's massive trade and budget deficits, and analysts have predicted more dollar weakness to come.
