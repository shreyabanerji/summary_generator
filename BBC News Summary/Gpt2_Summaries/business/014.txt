Telegraph newspapers axe 90 jobs

The Daily and Sunday Telegraph newspapers are axing 90 journalist jobs - 17% of their editorial staff. Pearson's Financial Times said last week it was offering voluntary redundancy to about 30 reporters. Telegraph executive Murdoch MacLennan said the two newspapers would add eight colour pages in the coming months. Many newspapers are investing in new printing machinery that enables them to print more colour pages, or in some cases, have colour on every page. In recent months News Corp's News International unit, which publishes The Sun and the News of the World, the Guardian Media Group, Trinity Mirror and the Daily Mail & General Trust have all announced substantial investments in new printing plants.
