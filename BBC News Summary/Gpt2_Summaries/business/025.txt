Yukos loses US bankruptcy battle

A judge has dismissed an attempt by Russian oil giant Yukos to gain bankruptcy protection in the US. The vast majority of the business and financial activities of Yukos continue to occur in Russia," Judge Clark said in her ruling. " Yukos had argued that a US court was entitled to declare it bankrupt before its Yugansk unit was sold, since it has local bank accounts and its chief finance officer Bruce Misamore lives in Houston. Yukos said it would consider its options in light of the ruling.
