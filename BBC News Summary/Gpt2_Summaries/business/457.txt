Germany calls for EU reform

German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder has called for radical reform of the EU's stability pact to grant countries more flexibility over their budget deficits. Mr Schroeder - a staunch supporter of the pact when it was set up in the 1990s - said exemptions were now needed to take into account the cost of domestic reform programmes and changing economic conditions. " The proposed changes would make it harder for the European Commission to launch infringement action against any state which breaches the pact's rules. The issue will also be discussed at Tuesday's Ecofin meeting of the finance ministers of all 25 EU members.
