FBI agent colludes with analyst

A former FBI agent and an internet stock picker have been found guilty of using confidential US government information to manipulate stock prices. Under the guise of protecting investors from fraud, Royer and Elgindy used the FBI's crime-fighting tools and resources actually to defraud the public," said US Attorney Roslynn Mauskopf. The charges carry sentences of up to 20 years. Defense lawyers contended that Mr Royer had been feeding information to Mr Elgindy and another trader in an attempt to expose corporate fraud.
