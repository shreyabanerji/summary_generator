Stormy year for property insurers

A string of storms, typhoons and earthquakes has made 2004 the most expensive year on record for property insurers, according to Swiss Re. The world's second biggest insurer said disasters around the globe have seen property claims reach $42bn (Â£21.5bn). " 2004 reinforces the trend towards higher losses," said Swiss Re.
