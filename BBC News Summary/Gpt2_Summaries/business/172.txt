Newest EU members underpin growth

The European Union's newest members will bolster Europe's economic growth in 2005, according to a new report. It warned that growth could also be threatened by attempts to reduce the United States' huge current account deficit which, in turn, might lead to significant volatility in exchange rates. Publishing its 2005 economic survey, the UNECE said central European countries such as the Czech Republic and Slovenia would provide the backbone of the continent's growth. The UK economy, on the other hand, is expected to slow in 2005, with growth falling from 3.2% last year to 2.5%.
