Qantas considers offshore option

Australian airline Qantas could transfer as many as 7,000 jobs out of its home country as it seeks to save costs, according to newspaper reports. More than 90% of the airline's staff are based in Australia. If Qantas were to follow the lead of other airlines moving staff 'offshore' 7,000 jobs could shift overseas, the newspaper reported. Unions reacted angrily to the reported disclosure, arguing that Qantas was profitable and did not need to take such action. "
