Man Utd to open books to Glazer

Manchester United's board has agreed to give US tycoon Malcolm Glazer access to its books. About 300 fans protested outside the Old Trafford ground two days ago. But it also stressed that it stayed opposed to Mr Glazer's proposal. " The board continues to believe that Mr Glazer's business plan assumptions are aggressive," the statement said, "and the direct and indirect financial strain on the business could be damaging." A group of five MPs are calling on the Department of Trade and Industry to block any takeover of the club by the US football magnate on public interest grounds. Mr Glazer's offer values the club at Â£800m ($1.5bn).
