Europe blames US over weak dollar

European leaders have openly blamed the US for the sharp rise in the value of the euro. At 0619 GMT on Tuesday, the dollar was up slightly at just above $1.29 to the euro, and buying 105.6 yen in Tokyo. Nicolas Sarkozy of France said he and his colleagues were unanimous in their worry that the decline of the dollar would hit Europe's economies by eating into their exports. " "If the Americans were to change their policy, it's up to them to say so," he said.
