Giving financial gifts to children

Your child or grandchild may want the latest toy this Christmas, but how about giving them a present that will help their financial future? Gifts of the financial variety might have a longer lasting impact. The first vouchers, worth £250 or £500 for low-income families, will be distributed from January. As the Child Trust Fund will not be in force in time for Christmas, relatives could invest their gifts in a higher rate children's deposit account, and use this as a feeder fund. This confirms that the account holder is a non-taxpayer and allows interest to be received without the deduction of income tax. Another favourite solution is Premium Bonds. Any prizes will be sent to the parent or child's guardian. One way to spread the risk is to invest in the stock market through a unit or investment trust.
