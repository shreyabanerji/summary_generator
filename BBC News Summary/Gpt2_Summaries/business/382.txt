Ban on forced retirement under 65

Employers will no longer be able to force workers to retire before 65, unless they can justify it. Under age discrimination proposals from the Department of Trade and Industry last year workers were to be allowed to work on till 70 if they wished. The British Chambers of Commerce welcomed the latest proposal. " It is now inevitable that older people will mount legal challenges to the decision using European law."
