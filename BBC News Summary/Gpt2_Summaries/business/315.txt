S&N extends Indian beer venture

The UK's biggest brewer, Scottish and Newcastle (S&N), is to buy 37.5% of India's United Breweries in a deal worth 4.66bn rupees ($106m:Â£54.6m). Millennium Alcobev will now be merged with United, which expects post-merger to have about half of India's beer market. Kingfisher has market share of about 29%. The airline, the brainchild of Mr Mallya, expects to start its operations by the end of April.
