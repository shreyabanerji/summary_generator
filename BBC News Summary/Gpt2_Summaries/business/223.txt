Gaming firm to sell UK dog tracks

Six UK greyhound tracks have been put up for sale by gaming group Wembley as part of a move which will lead to the break-up of the group. Wembley announced the planned sale as it revealed it was to offload its US gaming division to BLB Investors. Shares in Wembley were up 56 pence, or 7.6%, at 797p by mid-morning.
