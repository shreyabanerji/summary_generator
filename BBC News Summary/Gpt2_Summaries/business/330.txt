Fresh hope after Argentine crisis

Three years after Argentina was hit by a deadly economic crisis, there is fresh hope. Even the International Monetary Fund (IMF) admits this. " The subsequent devaluation saw thousands of people's life savings disappear. Three years ago, every sector [of the economy] was hit by the crisis," said entrepreneur Drayton Valentine. But since then, the general mood on the ground has improved dramatically, in part because the devaluation helped attract fresh direct investment from abroad and stimulate business within Brazil. " Argentina is still burdened by its failure to pay private creditors at the end of 2001. Understandably, they want more and until they do, both they and others are loath to continue lending. The situation is bad for those who had previously chosen to save in Argentina, " said Carlos Baez Silva, president of AARA, an association that represents bank account and bond holders. People have to deposit their money in the banks, not necessarily because they trust them but because crime is so high that people cannot have their money in their homes beneath their mattresses."
