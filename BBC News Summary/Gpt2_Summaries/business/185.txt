US bank 'loses' customer details

The Bank of America has revealed it has lost computer tapes containing account details of more than one million customers who are US federal employees. The bank gave no details of how the records disappeared, but said they had probably not been misused. We, with federal law authorities, have done a very robust, thorough investigation on this and neither we nor they would make the statement lightly that we believe those tapes to be lost," Alexandra Tower, a spokeswoman for the North Carolina-based bank, told Time magazine.
