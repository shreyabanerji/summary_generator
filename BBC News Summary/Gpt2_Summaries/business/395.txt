Delta cuts fares in survival plan

Delta Air Lines is cutting domestic fares by as much as 50% as part of a plan to ensure its financial survival. This latest move to boost business has prompted speculation other firms will be forced to match their fares, hurting revenues in the sector. It is also eliminating a Saturday-night stay requirement on discount fares and will give further reductions to customers opting for non-refundable tickets, booking in advance and online.
