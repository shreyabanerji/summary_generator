Wal-Mart fights back at accusers

Two big US names have launched advertising campaigns to "set the record straight" about their products and corporate behaviour. Wal-Mart kicked off the battle with adverts in newspapers like the Wall Street Journal, using an open letter from company president Lee Scott saying it was time for the public to hear the "unfiltered truth". Wal-Mart's average pay is almost twice the national minimum wage of $5.15 (Â£3.90) an hour, while employees are offered health and life insurance, company stock and a retirement plan, the adverts say. In California, the company is fighting opposition to new stores amid allegations it forces local competitors out of business. The move is in response to a British Medical Journal article that claimed "missing" Lilly documents linked Prozac to suicide and violent behaviour.
