Bush budget seeks deep cutbacks

President Bush has presented his 2006 budget, cutting domestic spending in a bid to lower a record deficit projected to peak at $427bn (Â£230bn) this year. Military spending is also set to rise by 4.8%, to reach $419.3bn. The state department's planned budget would rise to just under $23bn - a fraction of the defence department's request - including almost $6bn to assist US allies in the "war on terror". Mr Bush also wants to increase the amount given to poorer countries through his Millennium Challenge Corporation. A key spending line missing from proposals is the cost of funding the administration's proposed radical overhaul of Social Security, the pensions programme on which many Americans rely for their retirement income. Most Republicans, however, want them to stay in place.
