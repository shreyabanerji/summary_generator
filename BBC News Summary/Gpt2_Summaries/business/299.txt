US to rule on Yukos refuge call

Yukos has said a US bankruptcy court will decide whether to block Russia's impending auction of its main production arm on Thursday. Russian prosecutors are forcing the sale of the firm's most lucrative asset Yuganskneftegas to help pay a $27bn (Â£14bn) back tax bill, which they claim is owed by Yukos. Filing for bankruptcy protection in the US was "a last resort to preserve the rights of our shareholders, employees and customers," said Yukos chief executive Steven Theede. The company added it had opted to take action through American courts as US bankruptcy law gives worldwide jurisdiction over a debtor company's property and because it was seeking a judiciary willing to protect the value of shareholders' investments.
