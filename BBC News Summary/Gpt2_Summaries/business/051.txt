Fiat mulls Ferrari market listing

Ferrari could be listed on the stock market as part of an overhaul of Fiat's carmaking operations, the Financial Times has reported. Under the proposals - which the paper said could be announced within days - the iconic sportscar maker could be listed separately on the market. The Financial Times said Fiat may transfer Maserati within its wholly- owned Alfa Romeo division in an effort to exploit commercial synergies. Fiat, Italy's largest private sector employer, did not comment on the reported changes.
