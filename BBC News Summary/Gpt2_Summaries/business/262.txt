Asian quake hits European shares

Shares in Europe's leading reinsurers and travel firms have fallen as the scale of the damage wrought by tsunamis across south Asia has become apparent. But the disaster has little impact on stock markets in the US and Asia. Shares in Munich Re and Swiss Re - the world's two biggest reinsurers - both fell 1.7% as the market speculated about the cost of rebuilding in Asia. Investors pointed out, however, that declines probably would be industry specific, with the travel and insurance firms hit hardest. " It's still too early for concrete damage figures," Swiss Re's spokesman Floiran Woest told Associated Press. " Resort operator Tanco Holdings slumped 5%. The Indonesian rupiah lost as much as 0.6% against the US dollar, before bouncing back slightly to trade at 9,300.
