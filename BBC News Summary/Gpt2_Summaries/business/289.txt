UK economy facing 'major risks'

The UK manufacturing sector will continue to face "serious challenges" over the next two years, the British Chamber of Commerce (BCC) has said. The outlook for the service sector was "uncertain" despite an increase in exports and orders over the quarter, the BCC noted. The reduced threat of interest rate increases had contributed to improved confidence, it said. The Bank of England raised interest rates five times between November 2003 and August last year.
