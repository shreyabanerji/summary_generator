Steady job growth continues in US

The US created fewer jobs than expected in December, but analysts said that the dip in hiring was not enough to derail the world's biggest economy. "It was a respectable report," said Michael Moran, analyst at Daiwa Securities. Job creation was one of last year's main concerns for the US economy, and proved to be a main topic of debate in the US presidential election. A fall in consumer spending, which makes up about two-thirds of all US economic activity, could help limit the extent of any future interest rate rises.
