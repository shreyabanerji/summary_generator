Nissan names successor to Ghosn

Nissan has named a lifetime employee to run its operations after Carlos Ghosn, its highly successful boss, takes charge at Renault. Mr Ghosn is to become chairman and chief executive of Renault, which owns 44% of the Japanese carmaker, in April. He is currently in charge of Nissan's operations across Asia and Australasia and is credited with significantly improving its sales in China. Mr Ghosn said Mr Shiga's appointment would ensure a "seamless" transition in management. "
