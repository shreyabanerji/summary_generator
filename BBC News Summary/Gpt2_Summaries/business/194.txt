'Post-Christmas lull' in lending

UK mortgage lending showed a "post-Christmas lull" in January, indicating a slowing housing market, lenders have said. The BSA said mortgage approvals - loans approved but not yet made - were £2bn, down from £2.6bn in January 2004. At the same time, the British Bankers' Association (BBA) said lending was "weaker".
