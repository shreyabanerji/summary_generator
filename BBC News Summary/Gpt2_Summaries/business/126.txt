Barclays profits hit record level

Barclays, the UK's third-biggest bank, has seen annual pre-tax profits climb to record levels boosted by a sharp rise in business at its investment arm. Barclays' chief John Varley said the bank had "caught the winds" of a very strong world economy. According to analysts' forecasts, HSBC, the biggest UK bank by stock market valuation, will report profits of Â£9.4bn later this month. The cost overshoot is not in Barclays Capital but in the UK bank."
