US seeks new $280bn smoker ruling

The US Justice Department is to try to overturn a court ruling that threw out its claim for $280bn (Â£149bn) in damages from tobacco firms. The court room battle is seen as key in government attempts to fight smoking. " The tobacco companies denied the charges, saying that they never illegally conspired to promote smoking and fool the public. A three-judge panel agreed with the companies, finding that the case could not be brought under federal anti-racketeering laws.
