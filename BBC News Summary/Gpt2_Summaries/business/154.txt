Golden rule boost for Chancellor

Chancellor Gordon Brown has been given a Â£2.1bn boost in his attempts to meet his golden economic rule, which allows him to borrow only for investment. The extra leeway came after the Office for National Statistics said it had been measuring road expenditure data wrongly over the past five years. Accordingly, it seems very likely that some form of fiscal consolidation will be required in due course."
