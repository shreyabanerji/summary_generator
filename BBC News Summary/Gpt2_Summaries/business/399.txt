Indian oil firm eyes Yukos assets

India's biggest oil exploration firm, Oil & Natural Gas Corp (ONGC), says it is in talks to buy the former assets of troubled Russian crude producer Yukos. State-owned Rosneft now owns Yugansk and Russia has said it will turn the oil producer into a stand-alone firm. By buying into Yugansk, ONGC would be able to reduce its dependence on Gulf states for oil imports, Mr Westwood explained, especially as the chances of finding and exploiting resources within India are slim. " We forecast that Indian production will go into significant decline," Mr Westwood said. " ONGC is, however, not the only firm interested in Yugansk. Yukos has been battling the Russian authorities for more than a year and has filed for bankruptcy protection in the US.
