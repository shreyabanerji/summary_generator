UK bank seals South Korean deal

UK-based bank Standard Chartered said it would spend $3.3bn (Â£1.8bn) to buy one of South Korea's main retail banks. Standard Chartered expects about 16% of future group revenue to come from KFB. This time around, Standard Chartered is thought to have beaten HSBC to the deal. The country's banking market is three times the size of Hong Kong's with annual revenues of $44bn. In London, Standard Chartered's sale of 118 million new shares to institutional investors pushed its share price down, and contributing to the FTSE 100's 0.3% decline. Standard Chartered said it was buying 100% of KFB, an agreement that would bring an end to the bank's complex dual ownership. Although often thought of an export-driven economy, South Korea's service sector has overtaken manufacturing in the last decade or so.
