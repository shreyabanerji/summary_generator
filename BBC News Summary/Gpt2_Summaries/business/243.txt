Making your office work for you

Our mission to brighten up your working lives continues - and this time, we're taking a long hard look at your offices. Working from home presents a multitude of challenges. Do you build on the ideas of others - or are you a more introspective problem solver?. Isolated work environments mean this has to be carefully thought out, and a strategy has to be developed that suits both your personality and your industry. It is likely that the most efficient way of heating the building is with electricity. Ideally, it would be good to have a mains water supply and some means of drainage for toilet and washing facilities. Please click on the link to the right here to see my ideas for Marianne's barn. You may require an additional wireless access point in the renovated area. To really take advantage of wireless technology, you might consider a laptop computer and a docking station with external mouse and monitor.
