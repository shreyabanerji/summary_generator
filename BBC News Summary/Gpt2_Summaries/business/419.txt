$1m payoff for former Shell boss

Shell is to pay $1m (Â£522,000) to the ex-finance chief who stepped down from her post in April 2004 after the firm over-stated its reserves. Judy Boynton finally left the firm on 31 December, having spent the intervening time as a special advisor to chief executive Jeroen van der Veer. An investigation commissioned by Shell found that Ms Boynton had to share responsibility for the company's behaviour.
