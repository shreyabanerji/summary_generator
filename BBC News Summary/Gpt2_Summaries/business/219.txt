Rescue hope for Borussia Dortmund

Shares in struggling German football club Borussia Dortmund slipped on Monday despite the club agreeing a rescue plan with creditors on Friday. Creditors agreed on Friday to suspend interest payments until 2007. In addition to the interest-payment freeze, Borussia Dortmund also will get short-term loans to help pay salaries. On 14 March, one of these creditors - property investment fund Molsiris which owns the club's stadium - holds its AGM at which it will discuss the rescue plan.
