India seeks to boost construction

India has cleared a proposal allowing up to 100% foreign direct investment in its construction sector. A spokesman for DLF Builders, Dr Vancheshwar, told the BBC this will mean "better offerings" for consumers as well as builders. The government proposal states that foreign investment of up to 100% will be allowed on the 'automatic route' in the construction sector, on projects including housing, hotels, resorts, hospitals and educational establishments. This measure is designed to discourage foreign investors from buying and selling land speculatively, without developing it.
