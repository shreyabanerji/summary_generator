Nigeria to boost cocoa production

The government of Nigeria is hoping to triple cocoa production over the next three years with the launch of an ambitious development programme. Cocoa was the main export product in Nigeria during the 1960s. At the launch of the programme in the south-western city of Ibadan, Mr Bello explained that an additional aim of the project is to encourage the processing of cocoa in the country and lift local consumption. The country saw more than $1.2bn-worth of the beans exported during 2003-04.
