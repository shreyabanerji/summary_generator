Standard Life cuts policy bonuses

Standard Life, Europe's largest mutual life insurer, has cut bonuses for with-profit policyholders. It is the sixth time in three years Standard Life has made cuts to bonus rates, despite an 8.7% rise in the value of the with-profits fund in 2004. Profits made in good years are kept in reserve to pay investors an annual bonus even when the stock market performs badly. Standard Life came in for criticism for sticking with stock market investments during 2001 and 2002.
