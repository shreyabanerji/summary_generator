German bidder in talks with LSE

Deutsche Boerse bosses have held "constructive, professional and friendly" talks with the London Stock Exchange (LSE), its chief has said. Ahead of talks with the LSE on Friday, the pan-European bourse said it may be prepared to make its offer in cash. Deutsche Boerse could also face mounting opposition to a bid at home. It is not just the headquarters of the Boerse but also important market segments that must stay permanently in Frankfurt.
