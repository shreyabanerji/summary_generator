Tobacco giants hail court ruling

US tobacco companies have welcomed an appeal court's decision to reject the government's $280bn (Â£155bn) claim for alleged deceit about smoking dangers. The court in Washington found the case - filed by the Clinton administration in 1999 - could not be brought under federal anti-racketeering laws. Among the accused were Altria Group, RJ Reynolds Tobacco, Lorillard Tobacco, Liggett Group and Brown and Williamson. Prosecutors wanted the cigarette firms to "disgorge" $280bn in profits accumulated over the past 50 years and impose tougher rules on marketing their products. All we're saying today is that we have received the ruling and are reviewing it," a spokeswoman said on Friday.
