French wine gets 70m euro top-up

The French government is to hand its struggling wine industry 70m euros ($91m) in aid to help it battle falling sales and damaging overproduction. Wine makers, however, claimed the support did not go far enough. A further 15m euros will be made available to wine cooperatives, which make up the majority of French producers, in low interest loans. The aid package would "create a positive climate around French viticulture," Mr Bussereau said.
