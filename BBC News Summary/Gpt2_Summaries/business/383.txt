Fed warns of more US rate rises

The US looks set for a continued boost to interest rates in 2005, according to the Federal Reserve. The clear signal pushed the dollar up to $1.3270 to the euro by 0400 GMT on Wednesday, but depressed US shares. " That long trough "might be contributing to signs of potentially excessive risk-taking in financial markets", said the Federal Open Markets Committee (FOMC), which sets interest rates.
