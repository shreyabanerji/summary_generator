Tsunami to cost Sri Lanka $1.3bn

Sri Lanka faces a $1.3bn (Â£691m) bill in 2005 for reconstruction after the tsunami which killed more than 30,000 of its people, its central bank says. According to Mr Mendis, half the IMF support could come from a freeze on debt repayments, which would free up resources immediately. The Paris Club of 19 creditors meets on 12 January to discuss a debt moratorium for the nations hit by the tsunami, which ravaged south and east Asia on 26 December.
