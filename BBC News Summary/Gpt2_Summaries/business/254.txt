News Corp eyes video games market

News Corp, the media company controlled by Australian billionaire Rupert Murdoch, is eyeing a move into the video games market. According to the Financial Times, chief operating officer Peter Chernin said that News Corp is "kicking the tyres of pretty much all video games companies". And with their price tags reflecting the heavy investment by development companies, video games are proving almost as profitable as they are fun. Activision has a stock market capitalisation of about $2.95bn (Â£1.57bn), compared to EA's $17.8bn.
