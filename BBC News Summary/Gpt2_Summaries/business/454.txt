LSE doubts boost bidders' shares

Shares in Deutsche Boerse have risen more than 3% after a shareholder fund voiced opposition to the firm's planned takeover of the London Stock Exchange. Although none were prepared to speak on the record, most thought it was unlikely that TCI's opposition would halt the deal

"Obviously we'll have to wait and see, but I don't think it will make much difference. In voicing its opposition to the planned takeover, TCI said it would prefer to see Deutsche Boerse return $500m (Â£350m) to shareholders. Another Deutsche Boerse shareholder on Monday also appeared to back TCI's call. DB's shares were up 3.4% to 45.25 euros by 1030 GMT, the highest gainer in Frankfurt.
