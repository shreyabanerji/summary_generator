GM issues 2005 profits warning

General Motors has warned that it expects earnings this year be lower than in 2004. The car maker has diversified into financial services, and is extending the reach of General Motors Acceptance Corp (GMAC), which has said it may enter the home loans market. Attaining earnings of $10 a share remains GM's goal," the company said, adding it believes it can achieve this in 2007.
