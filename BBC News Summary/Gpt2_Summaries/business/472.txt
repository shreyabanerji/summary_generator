China suspends 26 power projects

China has ordered a halt to construction work on 26 big power stations, including two at the Three Gorges Dam, on environmental grounds. Altogether, the agency ordered 30 projects halted. Other projects included a petrochemicals plant and a port in Fujian. The stoppages would appear to be another step in the central government's battle to control projects licensed by local officials. In April 2004, central government officials ordered a halt to work on the nearby Nu River, which is part of a United Nations world heritage site, the Three Parallel Rivers site which covers the Yangtze, Mekong and Nu (also known as the Salween), according to the UK-published China Review.
