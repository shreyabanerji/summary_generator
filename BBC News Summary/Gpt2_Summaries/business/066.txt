German business confidence slides

German business confidence fell in February knocking hopes of a speedy recovery in Europe's largest economy. Observers had been hoping that a more confident business sector would signal that economic activity was picking up. Germany's economy grew 1.6% last year after shrinking in 2003. Latest indications are that growth is still proving elusive and Ifo president Hans-Werner Sinn said any improvement in German domestic demand was sluggish.
