UK economy ends year with spurt

The UK economy grew by an estimated 3.1% in 2004 after accelerating in the last quarter of the year, says the Office for National Statistics (ONS). But Steve Radley, chief economist at the manufacturers' organisation EEF, said: " These figures remain at odds with what is actually happening on the ground. " This outturn (of 0.7%) was well ahead of the market expectations and cast doubt on the scare stories doing the rounds surrounding the current state of the UK economy."
