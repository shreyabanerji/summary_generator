WorldCom director admits lying

The former chief financial officer at US telecoms firm WorldCom has admitted before a New York court that he used to lie to fellow board members. Mr Ebbers is on trial for fraud and conspiracy in relation to WorldCom's collapse in 2002. Mr Ebbers, 63, has always insisted that he was unaware of any hidden shortfalls in WorldCom's finances. Under 23 hours of questioning from a federal prosecutor, Mr Sullivan has previously told the court that he repeatedly warned Mr Ebbers that falsifying the books would be the only way to meet Wall Street revenue and earnings expectations.
