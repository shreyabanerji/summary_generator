US interest rates increased to 2%

US interest rates are to rise for the fourth time in five months, in a widely anticipated move. Another rise could be in store for December, some economists warned. The Dow Jones Industrial average closed down 0.89 points, or 0.01%, at 10,385.48. US firms created 337,000 jobs last month, twice the amount expected, while exports reached record levels in September. Analysts claimed the Fed's assessment of future economic growth was a positive one but stressed that the jury was still out on the prospect of a further rise in December.
