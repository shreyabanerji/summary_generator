Ukraine steel sell-off 'illegal'

The controversial sell-off of a Ukrainian steel mill to a relative of the former president was illegal, a court has ruled. Krivorizhstal is one of dozens of firms which he says were sold cheaply to friends of the previous administration. On Wednesday, Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko said as many as 3,000 firms could be included on the list of firms whose sale was being reviewed.
