McDonald's to sponsor MTV show

McDonald's, the world's largest restaurant chain, is to sponsor a programme on music channel MTV as part of its latest youth market promotion. In the US, food group Kraft is among firms that already have cut back on promoting sugar and fattening products to the young. Hooking up with MTV is expected to add extra momentum to McDonald's recent revival.
