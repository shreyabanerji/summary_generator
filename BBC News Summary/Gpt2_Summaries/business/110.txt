Growth in Japan evaporated in the three months to September, sparking renewed concern about an economy not long out of a decade-long trough. Exports - the usual engine of recovery - faltered, while domestic demand stayed subdued and corporate investment also fell short. The growth falls well short of expectations, but does mark a sixth straight quarter of expansion.
