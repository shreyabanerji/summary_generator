Putin backs state grab for Yukos

Russia's president has defended the purchase of Yukos' key production unit by state-owned oil firm Rosneft, saying it followed free market principles. Rosneft bought 100% of Baikal Finance Group, in a move that amounts to the renationalisation of a major chunk of Russia's booming oil industry. I think this is quite normal," the Russian president said. The latest announcement comes after more than a year of wrangling that has pushed Yukos, one of Russia's biggest companies to the brink of collapse. Even so, analysts reckon that the saga still has a long way to go. Further muddying the waters is a merger between Rosneft and Gazprom which authorities have said will go ahead as planned.
