SEC to rethink post-Enron rules

The US stock market watchdog's chairman has said he is willing to soften tough new US corporate governance rules to ease the burden on foreign firms. But European firms with secondary listings in New York have objected - arguing that the compliance costs outweigh the benefits of a dual listing. The 300-shareholder threshold has drawn anger as it effectively blocks the most obvious remedy, a delisting. Seen as particularly costly to implement, Section 404 obliges chief executives to take responsibility for the firm's internal controls by signing a compliance statement in the annual accounts. There are also rumours that two Chinese state-run banks - China Construction Bank and Bank of China - have abandoned plans for multi-billion dollar listings in New York later this year.
