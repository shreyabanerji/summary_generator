Argentina, Venezuela in oil deal

Argentina and Venezuela have extended a food-for-oil deal, which helped the former to overcome a severe energy crisis last year. The two countries also formalised a co-operation deal between Venezuelan energy firm PDVSA and Argentina's Enarsa. Under this deal, the Argentine market will be opened to Venezuelan investment.
