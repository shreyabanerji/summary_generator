Iraqi voters turn to economic issues

Beyond the desperate security situation in Iraq lies an economy in tatters. First rule of law, then the economy," says Radwan Hadi, deputy managing director of Aberdeen-based oil and gas consultancy Blackwatch Petroleum Services, which entered Iraq in 2003. The economy at present marks a big divide; Hopes are high for the future of finance, so foreign banks have been buying into the sector. But the involvement of foreign firms in the health and banking sectors and beyond sits uneasily with many Iraqis who are accustomed to the state taking responsibility for functions that are essential to making society work, observes Ms Alexander. " Opinion polls suggest that "people still want the state to take a leading role in providing these things", Ms Alexander says.
