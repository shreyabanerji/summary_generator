Euronext 'poised to make LSE bid'

Pan-European group Euronext is poised to launch a bid for the London Stock Exchange, UK media reports say. Euronext, which also operates an exchange in Lisbon, last week appointed UBS and ABN Amro as additional advisors. Responding to the LSE's rebuff, Deutsche Boerse - whose market capitalisation is more than Â£3bn - said it believed it could show its proposal offered benefits, and that it still hoped to make a cash bid. However, it has indicated it is open for further talks.
