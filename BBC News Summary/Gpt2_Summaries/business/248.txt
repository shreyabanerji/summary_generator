Survey confirms property slowdown

Government figures have confirmed a widely reported slowdown of the UK's housing market in late 2004. The government figures are the first official confirmation of falls in the market at the end of 2004. The biggest annual gains were made in Wales, where house prices were up by 23% in the fourth quarter. In the capital, the volume of sales fell by 23% from 36,185 in 2003 to 28,041 for the same period in 2004.
