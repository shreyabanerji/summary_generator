Turkey knocks six zeros off lira

Turkey is to relaunch its currency on Saturday, knocking six zeros off the lira in the hope of boosting trade and powering its growing economy. The transition to the new Turkish lira shows clearly that our economy has broken the vicious circle that it was imprisoned in for long years," said Sureyya Serdengecti, head of the Turkish Central Bank. " The new lira is also the symbol of the stable economy that we dreamed of for long years." Meanwhile, the economy is expanding at a healthy rate, with 7.9% growth expected in 2004. This will definitely affect people psychologically."
