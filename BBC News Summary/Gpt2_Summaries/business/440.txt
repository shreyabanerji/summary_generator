US trade deficit widens sharply

The gap between US exports and imports has widened to more than $60bn (Â£31.7bn), an all-time record. By 1650 GMT, the dollar was trading against the euro at $1.3280, almost a cent and a half weaker than before the announcement. The trade deficit is a large part of the latter. One small bright spot for US policy-makers was a slight decline in the deficit with China, often blamed for job losses and other economic woes.
