G7 backs Africa debt relief plan

G7 finance ministers have backed plans to write off up to 100% of the debts of some of the world's poorest countries. UK chancellor Gordon Brown said the London meeting of the world's seven richest nations would be remembered as "the 100% debt relief summit". Mr Brown said it was a major breakthrough for the international organisations to offer up to 100% multilateral debt relief - "the vast bulk" of money owed by the poorest countries. BBC correspondent Patrick Bartlett said while it was an agreement in principle, the organisations involved now have to look at how it would work in practice. Talks are continuing on how to finance increased overseas development assistance. But US Treasury Under-Secretary John Taylor said the US could not support the IFF because of its "legislative process". " But this particular mechanism does not work for the United States. A G8 summit is set to take place in July.
