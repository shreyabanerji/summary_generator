Novartis hits acquisition trail

Swiss drugmaker Novartis has announced 5.65bn euros ($7.4bn; Novartis, which last month forecast record sales for 2005, said it had bought all of Germany's Hexal. There are more than 150 generic drugmakers worldwide and analysts have predicted consolidation in a market that they call fragmented. I find it strange that they are making acquisitions in exactly those markets where they suffered price pressure."
