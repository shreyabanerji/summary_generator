EU to probe Alitalia 'state aid'

The European Commission has officially launched an in-depth investigation into whether Italian airline Alitalia is receiving illegal state aid. Commission officials are to look at Rome's provision of a 400m euro ($495m; Both the Italian government and Alitalia have repeatedly denied that the money - part of a vital restructuring plan - is state aid. Alitalia already enjoyed state aid in 1997.
