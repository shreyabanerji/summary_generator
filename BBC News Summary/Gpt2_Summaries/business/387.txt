Germany nears 1990 jobless level

German unemployment rose for the 11th consecutive month in December - making the year's average jobless total the highest since reunification. The seasonally adjusted jobless total rose a higher than expected 17,000 to 4.483 million, the Bundesbank said. The three years of stagnation in the German economy came to an end in 2004. By 2010, however, the Hartz IV reforms should help cut the average jobless rate to between 3% and 5%, he added.
