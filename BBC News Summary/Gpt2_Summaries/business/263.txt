Split-caps pay £194m compensation

Investors who lost money following the split-capital investment trust scandal are to receive £194m compensation, the UK's financial watchdog has announced. Eighteen investment firms involved in the sale of the investments agreed the compensation package with the Financial Services Authority (FSA). The FSA has been investigating whether investors were misled about the risks posed by split-capital investment trusts. Investors in these two firms may now have to take any compensation claim to the Financial Ombudsman Service or the courts.
