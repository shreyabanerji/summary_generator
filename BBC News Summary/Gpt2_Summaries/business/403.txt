WorldCom bosses' $54m payout

Ten former directors at WorldCom have agreed to pay $54m (Â£28.85m), including $18m from their own pockets, to settle a class action lawsuit, reports say. Earlier, the New York Times had reported that the personal payments were required as part of any deal at the start of negotiations. Two other outside former directors, Bert Roberts and Francesco Galesi, remain defendants in the lawsuit, said the newspaper. According to the WSJ, which cites people familiar to the case, the settling directors are expected to deny wrongdoing and state they are settling the case to eliminate the uncertainties and expense of further litigations.
