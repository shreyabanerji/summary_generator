US budget deficit to reach $368bn

The US budget deficit is set to hit a worse-than-expected $368bn (Â£197bn) this year, officials said on Tuesday. But the non-partisan fiscal watchdog notes the declines will help exporters and boost US economic growth. The CBO also forecast a total shortfall of $855bn for the years from 2006 to 2015, an improvement on previous projections. The figure could also be worsened by any further military costs.
