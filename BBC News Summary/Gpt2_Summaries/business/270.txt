Oil prices reach three-month low

Oil prices have fallen heavily for a second day, closing at three-month lows after news that US crude stocks have improved ahead of winter. The news calmed worries about winter shortages. Fears still remain over the level of US heating oil stocks, which are rising but remain down on 2004 levels. John Person, president of National Futures Advisory Services, said the EIA data indicated there should be adequate supplies for the next three months in the US. .
