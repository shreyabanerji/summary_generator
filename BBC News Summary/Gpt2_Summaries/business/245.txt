The 'ticking budget' facing the US

The budget proposals laid out by the administration of US President George W Bush are highly controversial. Without major changes in current policies and political prejudices, the federal budget simply cannot hold together. Under direct threat will be the federal government's ability to make good on its debts to the Social Security Trust Fund. This upward trend will force increased borrowing by the federal government, putting upward pressure on interest rates faced by consumers and business. Whether it will act wisely is another matter. Reducing domestic spending, or eliminating "waste, fraud and abuse" is toothless because this slice of the budget is too small to solve the problem. The biggest spending growth areas are defence (including homeland security), and health care for the elderly and the poor. To some extent, increases in these areas are inevitable. The sooner we face that reality, the sooner workable reforms can be pursued. Third must be the start of a serious debate on large-scale health care reform.
