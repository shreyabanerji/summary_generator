US retail sales surge in December

US retail sales ended the year on a high note with solid gains in December, boosted by strong car sales. Retail sales are seen as a major part of consumer spending - which in turn makes up two-thirds of economic output in the US. During that time, sales grew a lacklustre 2.9% in 2001 and 2.5% a year later. However, long-term claims slipped to their lowest level since 2001.
