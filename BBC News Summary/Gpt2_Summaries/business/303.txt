Brazil plays down Varig rescue

The Brazilian government has played down claims that it could step in to save the country's biggest airline. Brazil's airport authority chief Carlos Wilson had claimed the government was on the brink of stepping in to save Varig, Brazil's flagship airline. However, no jobs would be lost and the airline would keep on flying, he added. The depreciation of Brazil's currency has had a direct impact on the airline's dollar debt as well as some of its costs.
