Ukraine revisits state sell-offs

Ukraine is preparing what could be a wholesale review of the privatisation of thousands of businesses by the previous administration. But on Wednesday Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko said the government was planning to renationalise 3,000 firms. A day earlier, Mr Yushchenko - keen to reassure potential investors - had said only 30 to 40 top firms would be targeted. As a result, it was planning to resell rather than keep firms in state hands. " Mr Yushchenko became president after two elections in December, the first of which was annulled amid allegations of voting irregularities and massive street protests. A resale of Krivorizhstal could potentially triple the price, according to the Economist Intelligence Unit's Mr Hensel.
