Swiss cement firm in buying spree

Swiss cement firm Holcim has bid $800m (Â£429m) to buy two Indian cement firms and a holding company in the country. Shares in ACC fell 5.5% as investors, who thought the offer was underpriced, decided to sell. The deal with Aggregates will give Holcim, the world's second-biggest cement maker, an entry into the UK market and boost its presence in the US.
