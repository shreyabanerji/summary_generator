Fox attacks Blair's Tory 'lies' and says he has no qualms about lying in the election campaign. PM ratcheted up Labour's pre-election campaigning with a helicopter tour of the country and his speech at the party's spring conference. Blair said: "I have the same passion and hunger as when I first walked through the door of 10 Downing Street" Lib Dem leader Charles Kennedy is expected to attack Mr Blair's words as he begins a nationwide tour on Monday.
