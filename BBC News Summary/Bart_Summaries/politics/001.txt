Maternity pay for new mothers to rise by Â£1,400 as part of new proposals. Paid leave to be increased to nine months by 2007, says Trade and Industry Secretary Patricia Hewitt. Other plans include letting maternity pay be given to fathers and extending rights to parents of older children. Tories dismiss the maternity pay plan as "desperate", while the Liberal Democrats say it is misdirected.
