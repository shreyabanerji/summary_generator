Unilever blames poor results on sluggish decision making, a rise in discounted retailers and a wet European summer. Company also cited difficult trading conditions and a lack of demand for goods such as its Slimfast range. Shares fell 1% to 510.75 pence in London, and dropped by 1.2% to 50.50 euros in Amsterdam. Unilever said its main focus will be on improving profits, and it is planning to accelerate and increase investment in its 400 main brands.
