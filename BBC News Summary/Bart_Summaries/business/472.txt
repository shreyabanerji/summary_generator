China has ordered a halt to construction work on 26 big power stations, including two at the Three Gorges Dam. The State Environmental Protection Agency said the 26 projects had failed to do proper environmental assessments. Topping the list was a controversial dam on the scenic upper Yangtze River. The stoppages would appear to be another step in the central government's battle to control projects licensed by local officials.
