Study argues that more rigorous tax policing has benefited all Russian firms, even targets of the tax police. The paper's reasoning is complex, and is based on a sophisticated model of the relationship between tax regimes and corporate governance. Increasing the rigour with which taxes are collected encourages companies to become more transparent, forcing them to demonstrate their financial position far more accurately. The net result is that the extra amount companies pay in tax is more than compensated for by greater efficiency and financial soundness, the authors say. The report highlights the case of Sibneft, a Russian oil company that came close to merging with Yukos last year.
