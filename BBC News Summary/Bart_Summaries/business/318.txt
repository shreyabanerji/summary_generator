Mystery surrounds new Yukos owner Baikal Finance Group. Gazprom had been expected to win the auction but is thought to have failed to get finance for the deal. US judge banned Gazprom from taking part in the auction and barred international banks from providing the firm with cash. Yukos filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the US in a last-ditch attempt to hang on to Yuganskneftegas.
