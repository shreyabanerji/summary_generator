Oil companies get Russian setback. Only firms at least 51% Russian-owned will be permitted to bid. Exxon said it did not plan to take part in a new tender on a project for which it had previously signed a preliminary agreement. Miner Highland Gold said it regretted any limit on privatisation while BP, a big investor, declined to comment. Observers said that the move may represent a shift in policy, as Vladimir Putin puts the protection of national interests above free market dynamics.
