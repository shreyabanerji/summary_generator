Deutsche Bank says Yukos has few Texas ties beyond bank accounts and a Texas-based finance chief. It claims Yukos had artificially manufactured a legal case to stop the sale of its main asset. It had wanted to help fund Gazprom's plans for a $10bn bid for Yukos unit Yuganskneftegas. But the US bankruptcy court judge in Texas granted Yukos an injunction that barred Gazprom and its lenders from taking part.
