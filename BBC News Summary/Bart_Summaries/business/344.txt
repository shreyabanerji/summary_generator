Dollar hits $1.3516 in thin New York trade, before rallying to $ 1.3509. France's finance minister says the world faces "economic catastrophe" unless the US works with Europe and Asia on currency controls. Ministers from European and Asian governments have recently called on the US to strengthen the dollar. The US says it will let market forces determine the dollar's strength rather than intervene directly.
