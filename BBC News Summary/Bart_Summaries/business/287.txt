Japan's population is expected to peak at 127 million, then shrink to under 100 million by the middle of the century. Women can expect to live until 85, men until 78, four years longer than Americans and Europeans. Japan is the world's least fertile nation with childbirth rates of just two thirds of that in the US. The government is currently considering financial rewards for procreative couples similar to those in operation in Australia. But there would be no pay back until 2030, when today's babies are taxpayers, and the demographic crisis, like in Europe, starts to unfold in 2010. But for the Japanese economy, facing 8% fewer consumers by 2050 means slumping domestic sales of cars, hi-tech kit and home appliances, perhaps even another property crash.
