The Reserve Bank of Australia lifted interest rates 0.25% to 5.5%. The Bank said it had acted to curb inflation but the move was criticised by some analysts. Australian economy grew just 0.1% between October and December and 1.5% on an annual basis. Consumer spending remains strong, however, and the Bank is concerned about growing inflationary pressures.
