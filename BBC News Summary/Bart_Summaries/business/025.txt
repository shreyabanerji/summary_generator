Yukos filed for Chapter 11 protection in Houston in an unsuccessful attempt to halt the auction of its Yugansk division by the Russian authorities. The court ruling is a blow to efforts to get damages for the sale of Yugansk, which Yukos claims was illegally sold. Former Yukos boss Mikhail Khodorkovsky began testimony on Friday in his trial for fraud and tax evasion. He pleaded not guilty to the charges brought against him and denied involvement in any criminal activities.
