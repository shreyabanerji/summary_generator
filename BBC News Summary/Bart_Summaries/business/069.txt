Boeing unveils new long-distance 777 plane. The 777-200LR will be capable of flying almost 11,000 miles non-stop. Boeing hopes airlines will want to fly smaller aircraft over longer distances. Airbus, which overtook Boeing as the number one civilian planemaker in 2003, is focusing on so-called super jumbos. The latest tussle between Boeing and Airbus may prove to be a defining moment for the airline industry.
