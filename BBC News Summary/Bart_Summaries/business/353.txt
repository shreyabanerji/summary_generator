Giant waves damage S Asia economy. Governments, aid agencies, insurers and travel firms are counting the cost of the massive earthquake and waves that hammered southern Asia. Worst-hit areas are Sri Lanka, India, Indonesia and Thailand, with at least 23,000 people killed. Early estimates from the World Bank put the amount of aid needed at about $5bn (Â£2.6bn), similar to the cash offered Central America after Hurricane Mitch in 1998. Getting companies and business up and running also may play a vital role in helping the stricken countries recover from the events. In the Maldives islands, in the Indian ocean, two-thirds of all jobs depend on tourism. But the damage covers fishing, farming and businesses too, with hundreds of thousands of buildings and small boats destroyed.
