US politicians and citizens of all political persuasions are in for a dose of shock therapy. Without major changes in current policies and political prejudices, the federal budget simply cannot hold together. The trigger for the coming shock will be rising federal debt, which will grow in 10 years to more than half the nation's total annual output. The decline of the dollar is a warning sign that current economic trends cannot continue. The biggest spending growth areas are defence (including homeland security), and health care for the elderly and the poor. The Bush administration's chosen remedy is the least feasible one. Reducing domestic spending, or eliminating "waste, fraud and abuse" is toothless because this slice of the budget is too small.
