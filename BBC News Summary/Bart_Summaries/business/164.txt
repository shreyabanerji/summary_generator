Yukos sues Gazprom, Gazpromneft, Baikal and state oil firm Rosneft. Yukos claims more than $20bn (Â£11bn) in damages after Yugansk was sold in December to settle back taxes. Earlier this month it sued the Russian government for $28.3bn. Analysts question whether a US court has any jurisdiction over Russian companies.
