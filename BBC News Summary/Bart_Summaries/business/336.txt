Stephanie Villalba, 42, won her claim of unfair dismissal, resulting from her sacking in August 2003. Her partial victory is likely to cap her compensation to about Â£55,000, a tiny fraction of what she asked for. The extent of damages will be assessed in the New Year. Merrill Lynch said she was removed from her post because of extensive losses the firm was suffering on the continent.
