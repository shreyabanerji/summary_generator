Group Menatep is suing Russia for $28.3bn in back taxes. It says the money is owed to a trust set up by the Russian government. The trust was set up after the collapse of Yukos, a Russian state-owned oil company. It is now trying to get the money back by filing a lawsuit in the US. The case is expected to be heard by the end of the year.
