Creditors of South Korea's top credit card firm have said they will put the company into liquidation if its ex-parent firm fails to back a bail-out. LG Card's creditors have given LG group until Wednesday to sign up to a $1.1bn rescue package. LG Group has said any package should reflect the firm's new ownership and it will not accept an unfair burden.
