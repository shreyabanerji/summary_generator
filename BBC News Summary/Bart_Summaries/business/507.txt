UK economy grew by an estimated 3.1% in 2004 after accelerating in the last quarter of the year, says the Office for National Statistics. The annual figure marked out the best year since 2000, and was also well ahead of the 2.2% recorded in 2003. But output in the production sector contracted 0.5%, the second quarterly fall in row and a state of affairs that some economists classify as a recession.
