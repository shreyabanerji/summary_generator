European leaders gather in Rome on Friday to sign the new EU constitution. Many companies will be focusing on matters much closer to home - how to stay in business. Like northern England and industrial Scotland, those industries have been in long term decline. In Germany, industry is exporting more these days, but the economy as a whole is once again mired in slow growth and high unemployment. If Germany doesn't once again become the powerhouse of Europe, growth across the bloc is never going to be as strong as it could be. The EU set itself the target of being the most efficient economy in the world by 2010. Four years into that process, that seems further away than ever.
