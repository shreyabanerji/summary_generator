US insurer Marsh cuts 2,500 jobs as part of cost-cutting drive. Marsh posted a $676m (Â£352m) loss for the last three months of 2004. It blamed an $850m payout to settle a price-rigging lawsuit, brought by New York attorney general Elliot Spitzer. Analysts expect latest round of cuts to focus on its brokerage unit, which employs 40,000 staff.
