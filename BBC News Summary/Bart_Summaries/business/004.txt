British Airways blames high fuel prices for a 40% drop in profits. BA made a pre-tax profit of £75m ($141m) compared with £125m a year earlier. Turnover for the quarter was up 4.3% to £1.97bn, further benefiting from a rise in cargo revenue. BA warned that yields - average revenues per passenger - were expected to decline.
