Euronext and Deutsche Boerse have been in talks over a possible deal. If successful, the deal would make the LSE the biggest stock exchange in the world. The deal would also see Deutsche Boorse take control of the German stock exchange's clearing house, which is owned by Deutsche Bank. The LSE has said it is not in a position to make such a deal.
