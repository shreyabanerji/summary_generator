European Union's newest members will bolster Europe's economic growth in 2005. The eight central European states which joined the EU last year will see 4.6% growth. The 12 Euro zone countries will put in a "lacklustre" performance, generating growth of only 1.8%. The global economy will slow in 2005, the UNECE forecasts, due to widespread weakness in consumer demand.
