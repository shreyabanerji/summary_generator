Ukraine revisits state sell-offs. Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko said the government was planning to renationalise 3,000 firms. The government says many privatised firms were sold to allies of the last administration at rock-bottom prices. More than 90,000 businesses in all, from massive corporations to tiny shopfronts, have been sold off since 1992 as the command economy built up when Ukraine was part of the Soviet Union was dismantled.
