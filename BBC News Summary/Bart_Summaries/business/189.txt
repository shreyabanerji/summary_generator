Sergio Marchionne replaces Herbert Demel as chief executive of Fiat Auto. Mr Demel left the company in November 2003 after being recruited by former Fiat chief executive Giuseppe Morchio. The car business is expected to make a loss of about 800m euros in 2004. Fiat underperformed the market in Europe last year, seeing flat sales.
