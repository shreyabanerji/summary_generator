Lisbon economic targets set out at the Lisbon summit of European Union leaders in 2000 were meant to help Europe leapfrog its way past the United States to become the world's leading economy by 2010. A new report by former Dutch prime minister Wim Kok says too many of the targets will be seriously missed. The report comes at a time when Europe's competitive position is waning. The European economic and social model needs to change, but not so much so that social and environmental issues take a backseat to economic growth, the report says. But some analysts believe that the report doesn't come up with the sort of innovative policies and thinking needed to make the Lisbon targets a reality. It will be up to the incoming president of the European Commission, Jose Manuel Barroso, to adopt Mr Kok's recommendations.
