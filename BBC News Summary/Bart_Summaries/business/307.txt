Cairn shares slump on oil setback. Shares in Cairn Energy, a UK oil firm, have closed down 18% after a disappointing drilling update. The company said tests had shown no significant finds in one of its Indian oil fields, but was upbeat about the potential of other areas. It also said the Indian government had told it to pay a production tax, for which it argues it is not liable.
