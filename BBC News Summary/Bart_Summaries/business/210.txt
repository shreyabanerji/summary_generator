IMF may be able to sell billions of dollars of gold and use the cash to cancel debts owed by the world's poorest nations. Plan was put forward by G7 finance ministers over the weekend. Price of gold fell to $413.50 an ounce in Asia, before rebounding slightly in early European trading. US, which can veto any plan to sell IMF gold, said it is looking at other ways of solving the problem.
