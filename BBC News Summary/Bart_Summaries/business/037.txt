Yoshiaki Tsutsumi was once ranked as the world's richest man. He used his wealth and influence to bring the Winter Olympic Games to Nagano in 1998. Last year he was forced to resign from all the posts he held in his business empire. He was accused of falsifying the share-ownership structure of Seibu Railways.
