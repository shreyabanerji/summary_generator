Council of Mortgage Lenders, British Bankers Association and Building Societies Association all say mortgage lending is slowing. CML figures showed gross lending fell by 4% in November as the number of people buying new homes fell. The CML said that loans for new property purchases fell 25% year-on-year to 85,000 - the lowest total seen since February 2003.
