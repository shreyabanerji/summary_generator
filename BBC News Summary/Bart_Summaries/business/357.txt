The Open Society Institute (OSI) has accused Kazakhstan officials of trying to close down its local office. A demand for unpaid taxes and fines of $600,000 (Â£425,000) is politically motivated, the OSI claimed. The organisation has found itself in trouble after being accused of helping to topple Georgia's former president.
