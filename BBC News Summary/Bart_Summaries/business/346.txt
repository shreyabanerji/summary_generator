Munich Re and Swiss Re, the world's two biggest reinsurers, have said exposure will be less than for other disasters. Rebuilding costs are likely to be cheaper than in developed countries, and many of those affected will not have insurance. Early estimates from the World Bank put the amount of aid needed for the worst affected countries at about $5bn (Â£2.6bn), similar to the cash offered to Central America after Hurricane Mitch. At least 10 countries have been affected, with Sri Lanka, Indonesia, India and Thailand among the worst hit.
