US retailers posted mixed results for December - with luxury retailers faring well while many others were forced to slash prices to lift sales. Nordstrom said same store sales were 9.3% higher than during the same period last year. Trendy youth labels also sold well, with sales jumping 28% at young women's clothing retailer Bebe Stores and 32.2% at American Eagle Outfitters. Wal-Mart only saw its sales rise after it cut prices.
