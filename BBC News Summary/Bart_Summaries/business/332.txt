Putin backs state grab for Yukos by state-owned oil firm Rosneft. Putin says it followed free market principles to ensure interests were met. Russian government put Yukos's Yuganskneftegas subsidiary up for sale last week after hitting the company with a $27bn bill for back taxes and fines. Yukos accused Gazprom of illegally taking part in Sunday's auction. It has said it will be seeking damages of $20bn.
