Yukos claims it transferred $27m into two Texas bank accounts. But Deutsche Bank says documents were backdated to strengthen the case. Yukos is suing Gazprom, its unit Gazpromneft, Rosneft and the shell company which won the auction of Yugansk. The sale went ahead, despite an order from the US bankruptcy court ordered that it should be stopped. In the end, the auction was won by an unknown shell company for $9.4bn - much less than most assessments of its value.
