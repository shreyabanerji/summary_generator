10 former WorldCom directors agree to pay $54m, including $18m from their own pockets, to settle a class action lawsuit. The remaining $36m will be paid by the directors' insurers. A formal agreement on the payout is expected to be signed on Thursday in a US district court in Manhattan. WorldCom filed for bankruptcy in 2002 when an $11bn accounting scandal was unearthed.
