Yukos will return to a US court on Wednesday to seek sanctions against Baikal Finance Group, the little-known firm which has bought its main asset. Yukos' US lawyers will attempt to haveBaikal assets frozen after the Russian government ignored a court order last week blocking the sale. The future ownership of Yuganksneftegas remains unclear amid widespread suggestions that Baikkal was established as a front for other interests.
