Yukos unit fetches $9bn at auction in Moscow. Baikal Finance Group outbid favourite Gazprom, the state-controlled gas monopoly, to buy Yuganskneftegas. Yukos reacted immediately by repeating its view that the auction was illegal in international and Russian law, and said Baikkal had bought itself trouble. The sale came despite a restraining order issued by a US court dealing with the firm's bankruptcy application for Chapter 11 protection. The unit is at the heart of Yukos - pumping close to a million barrels of oil a day. The government claims the oil giant owes more than $27bn in taxes and fines.
