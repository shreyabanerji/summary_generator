More than 2,000 business and political leaders from around the globe are arriving in the Swiss mountain resort. Anti-globalisation campaigners have called off a demonstration planned for the weekend. The Brazilian city of Porto Alegre will host the rival World Social Forum, timed to run in parallel with the WEF's ritzier event in Davos. "Taking responsibility for tough choices" is this year's official talking point, hinting at a welter of knotty problems. The forum will be dominated by business issues - from outsourcing to corporate leadership - with bosses of more than a fifth of the world's 500 largest companies.
