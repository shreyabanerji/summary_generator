Stock markets in Indonesia and India have hit all-time highs this week. Bigger markets further afield have barely twitched. The notional insurance cost of the disaster will have little bearing on corporate bottom lines. Academic consensus is that major disasters are largely neutral in their longer-term economic impact. Even the costliest natural disaster is rendered minuscule by the global capital market - currently $30 trillion and rising. shocks rarely translate into economic slumps, and economic woes rarely seriously undermine markets. The trillion-dollar debts of Japan's banks, for example, have had no effect on stock markets.
