G7 backs Africa debt relief plan. G7 finance ministers have backed plans to write off up to 100% of the debts of some of the world's poorest countries. Some 37 countries could benefit after a case-by-case review by bodies including the World Bank and the IMF. But the US says it cannot support Mr Brown's International Finance Facility to boost aid to developing countries. BBC correspondents said the meeting had produced some movement towards the UK's ambitions, but much work was needed. Talks also centred on the impact of the rising economies of China and India and how the US, Europe and Japan can act to boost global economic growth.
