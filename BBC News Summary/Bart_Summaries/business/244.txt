Market unfazed by Aurora setback. Carnival shares in London were down a single penny, or 0.03%, at Â£32.26. Analysts expect the impact on the rest of the cruise business to be limited. The hundreds of disappointed passengers who have now had to give up the opportunity to spend the next three months on the Aurora have got both a refund and a credit for another cruise. That should mitigate some of the PR risk, both for Carnival and its main competitor, Royal Caribbean.
