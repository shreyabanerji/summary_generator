All conversions between the US dollar and Cuba's "convertible" peso will from 8 November be subject to a 10% tax. Cuba badly needs dollars to pay for essential items such as food, fuel and medicine. Cuba's tourist industry has been one of its few economic success stories over the last ten years and, according to the UN Economic Commission for Latin America, is now worth $3bn to the country. The tax will hit the families of Cuban exiles hardest as they benefit from the money their displaced relatives send home.
