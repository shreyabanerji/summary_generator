Arsenal vice-chairman David Dein says the club may seek a full listing on the London Stock Exchange. Mr Dein also warned the current level of TV coverage of the Premiership may be reaching saturation level. The club is currently listed on the smaller Ofex share exchange. Arsenal is due to move into its new 60,000-seater Emirates Stadium at Ashburton Grove for the start of the 2006/07 season.
