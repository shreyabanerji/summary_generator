Argentina has made a remarkable recovery from a hideous and lengthy recession. The country's economy is set to grow about 8% this year after seeing 9% growth last year. Argentina is still burdened by its failure to pay private creditors at the end of 2001. President Nestor Kirchner's administration is still trying to hammer out an agreement with the creditors, but with the debts' nominal value standing at around $100bn it is not proving easy. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) admits that "the Argentine authorities are proud, should be proud, of the strong performance of the economy," Thomas Dawson, an IMF director, said earlier this month. But the situation is bad for those who had previously chosen to save in Argentina, said Carlos Baez Silva, president of AARA.
