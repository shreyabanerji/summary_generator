BBC poll indicates economic gloom. Almost 23,000 people in 22 countries were questioned for the poll. Poll found that a majority or plurality of people in 13 countries believed the economy was going downhill. But when asked about their own family's financial outlook, a majority in 14 countries said they were positive about the future. The Philippines was among the most upbeat countries on prospects for respondents' families, but one of the most pessimistic about the world economy.
