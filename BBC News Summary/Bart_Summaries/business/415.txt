UK house prices dipped slightly in November, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister said. Average house price fell marginally to £180,226, from £ 180,444 in October. But annual house price inflation is still strong, up 13.8% in the year to November. Economists forecast that ODPM figures are likely to show a weakening in annual houseprice growth in coming months.
