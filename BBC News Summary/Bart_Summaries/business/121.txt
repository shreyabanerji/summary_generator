US interest rates increased to 2% for the fourth time in five months. Analysts said a clear-cut victory for President Bush in last week's election paved the way for a rise. Another rise could be in store for December, some economists warned. The further rise in US rates is unlikely to have a direct bearing on UK monetary policy. The Bank of England has kept interest rates on hold at 4.75% for three months.
