BMW cash to fuel Mini production with Â£100m of new investment. 200 new jobs are to be created at the Oxford factory, including modernised machinery and a new body shell production building. The result of the investment could be to raise output to more than 200,000 cars from 2007. The rise, from 189,000 last year, is a response to rapidly-rising demand and could help wipe out waiting lists. Last year, almost one in six cars sold by the BMW group was a Mini.
