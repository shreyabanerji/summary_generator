Yukos has filed for bankruptcy protection in the US in an attempt to halt the forced sale of its main production arm. Russian authorities are due to auction off Yuganskneftegas on 19 December to pay a huge tax bill sent to Yukos. Yukos maintains that the forced auction is illegal and "will cause the company to suffer immediate and irreparable harm" Many commentators believe the Russian government's aggressive pursuit of Yukos is a politically-motivated response to the political ambitions of its former chief executive, Mikhail Khodorkovsky.
