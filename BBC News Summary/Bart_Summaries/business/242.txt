US business tycoon Malcolm Glazer has made a fresh approach to Manchester United. Reports put the offer at 300p per share, which would value the club at Â£800m. A previous approach to the United board by Mr Glazer in October last year was turned down. The key to any successful bid will be attracting the support of United's largest shareholders, the Irish horse racing tycoons John Magnier and JP McManus. United's players appear unhappy at the prospect of a takeover, with Rio Ferdinand saying: "No-one knows what this guy will be bringing to the table"
