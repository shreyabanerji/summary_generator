US magazine Mobile PC has compiled an all-time top 100 list of gadgets. The oldest "gadget" in the top 100 is the abacus, which the magazine dates at 190 A.D. The list also contains plenty of oddities: the Pez sweet dispenser, 1980s toy Tamagotchi and the bizarre Ronco inside the shell egg scrambler. The most popular gadget of the moment, the Apple iPod, is at number 12 in the list while the first Sony transistor radio is atnumber 13. The Tivo personal video recorder is the newest device to make the top 10, which also includes the first flash mp3 player, as well as the first "successful" digital camera and mobile phone. The magazine specified that gadgets also needed to be a "self-contained apparatus that can be used on its own, not a subset of another device" and included only items that were "potentially mobile" and could be used in any way, including laptops and mobiles. The Apple Powerbook 100 was chosen as the greatest gadget of all time.
