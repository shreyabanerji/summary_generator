The Kyrgyz Republic is using invisible ink and ultraviolet readers in the country's elections as part of a drive to prevent multiple voting. The use of ink has been controversial - especially among groups perceived to be pro-government. The country's widely watched parliamentary elections are scheduled for 27 February. The German Embassy, the Soros Foundation and the KyrgyZ government have all contributed to purchase transparent ballot boxes. The U.S. government agreed to fund all expenses associated with this decision. The move is seen by many experts as backsliding from the high point it reached in the mid-1990s with a hastily pushed through referendum in 2003.
