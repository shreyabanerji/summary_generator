Wi-fi web reaches farmers in Peru through a network of community computer centres. The pilot scheme in the Huaral Valley, 80 kilometres north of the capital Lima, aims to offer the 6,000-strong community up-to-date information. The network has been three years in the making and was officially inaugurated in September. The Board of Irrigation Users aims to make the network self-sustainable within three years, through the cash generated by using the telecentres as internet cafes.
