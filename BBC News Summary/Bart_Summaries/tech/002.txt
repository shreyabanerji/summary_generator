Chinese authorities closed 12,575 net cafes in the closing months of 2004. The move is the latest in a series of steps the Chinese government has taken to crack down on what it considers to be immoral net use. Chinese net cafes operate under a set of strict guidelines and many of those most recently closed broke rules that limit how close they can be.
