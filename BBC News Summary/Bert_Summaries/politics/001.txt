Maternity pay for new mothers is to rise by £1,400 as part of new proposals announced by the Trade and Industry Secretary Patricia Hewitt. We will definitely extend the maternity pay, from the six months where it now is to nine months, that's the extra £1,400." The Shadow Secretary of State for the Family, Theresa May, said: " She said her party would boost maternity pay in the first six months to allow more women to stay at home in that time. Ms Hewitt also stressed the plans would be paid for by taxpayers, not employers.
