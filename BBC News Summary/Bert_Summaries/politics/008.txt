Women MPs reveal sexist taunts

Women MPs endure "shocking" levels of sexist abuse at the hands of their male counterparts, a new study shows. Harriet Harman told researchers of the sheer hostility prompted by her advancement to the Cabinet: " Lots of people say it's like an old boys club. " I've always said to me it feels more like a teenage public school - you know a public school full of teenagers." This was mainly because there were more women present in Parliament who were not prepared to "put up with" the sexist attitudes they came across, Prof Lovenduski said.
