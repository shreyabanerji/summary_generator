'Errors' doomed first Dome sale

But Edward Leigh, who is chairman of the Commons public accounts committee, warned the government would have to work hard to ensure taxpayers would get full benefit from the Dome deal. This report also shows that the first attempt to sell the Dome proved a complete fiasco.
