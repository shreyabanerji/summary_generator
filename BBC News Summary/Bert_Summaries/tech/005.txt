Technology gets the creative bug

The hi-tech and the arts worlds have for some time danced around each other and offered creative and technical help when required. To mark the initiative's launch, a major international art installation is to open on 15 April in Brussels, with a further exhibit in Madrid later in the summer. In their previous works they used the Quake game graphics engine. BT's own engine, Tara (Total Abstract Rendering Architecture) has been in development since 2001 and has been used to recreate virtual interactive models of buildings for planners. But collaboration between art and digital technology is by no means new, and many keen coders, designers, games makers and animators argue that what they create is art itself. The partnership between artists and technologists is part of trying to understand the creative potential of technologies like broadband net, according to Mr Stone. " This is not just about putting art galleries and museums online," he said. " It is about how can everyone have the best seat in house and asking if technology has a role in solving that problem."
