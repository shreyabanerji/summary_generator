Ink helps drive democracy in Asia

The Kyrgyz Republic, a small, mountainous state of the former Soviet republic, is using invisible ink and ultraviolet readers in the country's elections as part of a drive to prevent multiple voting. The Kyrgyz Republic is seen by many experts as backsliding from the high point it reached in the mid-1990s with a hastily pushed through referendum in 2003, reducing the legislative branch to one chamber with 75 deputies. The ink is sprayed on a person's left thumb. If the ink shows under the UV light the voter will not be allowed to enter the polling station. The greatest part of the opposition to ink has often been sheer ignorance. Others, such as the aggressively middle of the road, Coalition of Non-governmental Organizations, have lauded the move as an important step forward. However, in reality, the ink is very effective at getting under the cuticle of the thumb and difficult to wash off.
