Markets signal Brazilian recovery

The Brazilian stock market has risen to a record high as investors display growing confidence in the durability of the country's economic recovery. The market's buoyancy reflects optimism about the Brazilian economy, which could grow by as much as 4.5% in 2004. For the first time in decades, we have all three economic policy pillars in line during a recovery," Finance Minister Antonio Palocci told the Associated Press news agency. " Government accounts are in surplus, we have a current account surplus and inflation is under control."
