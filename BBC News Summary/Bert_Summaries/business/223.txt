Gaming firm to sell UK dog tracks

Six UK greyhound tracks have been put up for sale by gaming group Wembley as part of a move which will lead to the break-up of the group. Wembley announced the planned sale as it revealed it was to offload its US gaming division to BLB Investors. The US business accounts for about 90% of Wembley's operating profit and consists of operations in Rhode Island and Colorado.
