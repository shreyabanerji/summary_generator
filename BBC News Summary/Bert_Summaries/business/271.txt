Arsenal 'may seek full share listing'

Arsenal vice-chairman David Dein has said the club may consider seeking a full listing for its shares on the London Stock Exchange. Mr Dein also warned the current level of TV coverage of the Premiership may be reaching saturation level, with signs that match attendances have been dropping off in the first few months of this season. When Arsenal moves to its new stadium it will see its proportion of turnover from media earnings drop from 52% this season to 34% in two years' time. Since the formation of the Premier League in season 1992/93, Premiership clubs have seen their income from television soar. "
