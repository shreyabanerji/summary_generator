Nasdaq planning $100m share sale

The owner of the technology-dominated Nasdaq stock index plans to sell shares to the public and list itself on the market it operates. According to a registration document filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Nasdaq Stock Market plans to raise $100m (Â£52m) from the sale. It technically went public in 2002 when the stock started trading on the OTC Bulletin Board, which lists equities that trade only occasionally.
