Wall Street cheers Bush victory

The US stock market has closed higher in response to George W Bush's victory in the presidential elections. Many investors believe that Mr Bush's policies are more business-friendly than those of his Democrat challenger, John Kerry. The higher share prices also reflect relief that a clear winner has emerged from what proved to be a tight poll. Investors had worried that the outcome of the poll would be inconclusive, paving the way for a repeat of the legal wrangling that marred the 2000 election. Economic issues, as well as the war in Iraq, were the forefront of the campaign.
