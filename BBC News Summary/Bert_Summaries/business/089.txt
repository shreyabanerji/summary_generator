Europe blames US over weak dollar

European leaders have openly blamed the US for the sharp rise in the value of the euro. Nicolas Sarkozy of France said he and his colleagues were unanimous in their worry that the decline of the dollar would hit Europe's economies by eating into their exports. " The comments come a day after US Treasury Secretary John Snow said a strong dollar was "in America's interest". "If the Americans were to change their policy, it's up to them to say so," he said.
