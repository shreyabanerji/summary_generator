Revenues at media group Reuters slipped 11% during 2004, mainly due to the weakness of the dollar, the group said. Improving customer relationships, more competitive products and continued strong cost discipline position us well for 2005," chief executive Tom Glocer said, adding the company was beginning "to look beyond recovery to growth".
