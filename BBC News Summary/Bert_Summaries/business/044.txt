Japan economy slides to recession

The Japanese economy has officially gone back into recession for the fourth time in a decade. On Wednesday, the government revised growth figures from earlier in 2004 which, when taking into account performance in the most recent period, effectively tips Japan into recession. A recession is commonly defined as two consecutive quarters of negative growth, although the Japanese government takes other factors into account when judging the status of its economy. The economy must be assessed comprehensively and we cannot look at GDP alone," Mr Takenaka stressed.
