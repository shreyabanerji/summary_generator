Georgia plans hidden asset pardon

Georgia is offering a one-off 'tax amnesty' to people who hid their earnings under the regime of former president Eduard Shevardnadze. Mr Saakashvili, elected president in January after Mr Shevardnadze was toppled, has urged the Georgian Parliament to approve the amnesty as soon as possible. By declaring their assets and paying the one-off tax, people would be able to "legalise their property", Mr Saakashvili stressed. The amnesty will not extend to people who made money through drugs trafficking or international money laundering.
