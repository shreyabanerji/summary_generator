BP surges ahead on high oil price

Oil giant BP has announced a 26% rise in annual profits to $16.2bn (Â£8.7bn) on the back of record oil prices. BP chief executive Lord Browne said the results were strong "both operationally and financially." Despite the record annual profits figure, BP's performance was below the expectations of some City analysts. However, Lord Browne rejected calls for a windfall tax on his company's huge profits, saying that in the North Sea it paid progressively more tax, the more profits it made.
