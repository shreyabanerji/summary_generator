SBC plans post-takeover job cuts

US phone company SBC Communications said it expects to cut around 12,800 jobs following its $16bn (Â£8.5bn) takeover of former parent AT&T.

SBC said 5,125 positions would go as a result of network efficiencies. AT&T is a long-distance telecoms firm, while SBC is mainly focused on the local market in the western US.
