US to probe airline travel chaos

The US government is to investigate two airlines- US Airways and Delta Air Lines' Comair subsidiary - after travel chaos over the Christmas weekend. Comair's computer breakdown plunged its flight-crew scheduling system into disarray. However, union officials denied there had been a deliberate "sickout". Disruptions to flight schedules could discourage customers from flying with US Airways, reducing revenues. Comair "deeply regrets the inconvenience to all of our customers caused by the severe winter storm in the Ohio River Valley during the busy holiday season, exacerbated by problems with the airline's crew scheduling system, causing additional flight delays and cancellations," the Delta subsidiary said in a statement.
