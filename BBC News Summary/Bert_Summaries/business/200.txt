Cuba winds back economic clock

Fidel Castro's decision to ban all cash transactions in US dollars in Cuba has once more turned the spotlight on Cuba's ailing economy. All conversions between the US dollar and Cuba's "convertible" peso will from 8 November be subject to a 10% tax. Critics of the measure argue that it is a step backwards, reflecting the Cuban president's desire to increase his control of the economy and to clamp down on private enterprise. This money, known as remittances, can amount to as much as $1bn a year. Much of Cuba's basic infrastructure is in a state of disrepair. The main impact could be that it will create a black market which you typically see in countries, like Venezuela, which have restrictions on capital," he says.
