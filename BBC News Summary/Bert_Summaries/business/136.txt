Ukraine revisits state sell-offs

Ukraine is preparing what could be a wholesale review of the privatisation of thousands of businesses by the previous administration. But on Wednesday Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko said the government was planning to renationalise 3,000 firms. More than 90,000 businesses in all, from massive corporations to tiny shopfronts, have been sold off since 1992, as the command economy built up when Ukraine was part of the Soviet Union was dismantled. The list "will be limited and final, and will not be extended after its completion", he said. As a result, it was planning to resell rather than keep firms in state hands. " We say Krivorizhstal was stolen, and at any cost we will return it to the state," Mr Yushchenko told an investors' conference in Kiev.
