Brazil plays down Varig rescue

The Brazilian government has played down claims that it could step in to save the country's biggest airline. However, the country's vice president Jose Alencar has said the government still is looking for a solution. However, no jobs would be lost and the airline would keep on flying, he added. Varig, which operates in 18 countries apart from Brazil, has been driven to the brink of collapse because of the country's economic downturn.
