Wal-Mart fights back at accusers

Two big US names have launched advertising campaigns to "set the record straight" about their products and corporate behaviour. The group is trying to see off criticism over it pay deals, benefits package and promotion strategy. Meanwhile, drugs group Eli Lilly is planning a campaign against "false" claims about its product Prozac. Wal-Mart kicked off the battle with adverts in newspapers like the Wall Street Journal, using an open letter from company president Lee Scott saying it was time for the public to hear the "unfiltered truth". Unions accuse Wal-Mart of paying staff less than its rivals do, with fewer benefits.
