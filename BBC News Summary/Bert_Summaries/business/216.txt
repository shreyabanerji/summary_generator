Nissan names successor to Ghosn

Nissan has named a lifetime employee to run its operations after Carlos Ghosn, its highly successful boss, takes charge at Renault. Mr Ghosn transformed Nissan into a fast-growing and profitable business. I have full confidence in Toshiyuki Shiga and the new leadership team to help me implement the next chapter of Nissan's growth."
