Split-caps pay £194m compensation

Investors who lost money following the split-capital investment trust scandal are to receive £194m compensation, the UK's financial watchdog has announced. Splits were marketed as a low-risk way to benefit from rising share prices. The FSA has been investigating whether investors were misled about the risks posed by split-capital investment trusts. Investors in these two firms may now have to take any compensation claim to the Financial Ombudsman Service or the courts.
