US interest rates increased to 2%

US interest rates are to rise for the fourth time in five months, in a widely anticipated move. US companies created twice as many jobs as expected in October while exports hit record levels in September. In a statement, the Fed said that long-term inflation pressures remained "well contained" while the US economy appeared to be "growing at a moderate pace despite the rise in energy prices". The economy is doing a bit better right now but there are still some concerns about geopolitics, employment and the price of oil," he added.
