Profits slide at India's Dr Reddy

Profits at Indian drugmaker Dr Reddy's fell 93% as research costs rose and sales flagged. Research and development of new drugs is continuing apace, with R&D spending rising 37% to 705m rupees - a key cause of the decrease in profits alongside the fall in sales. Sales were down more than 25% from the previous year to 1.4bn rupees in the face of strong competition both at home, and in the US and Europe.
