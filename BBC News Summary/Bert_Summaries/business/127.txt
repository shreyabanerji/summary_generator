Yukos owner sues Russia for $28bn

The majority owner of embattled Russian oil firm Yukos has sued the Russian government for $28.3bn (Â£15.2bn). The Russian government's argument for selling Yuganskneftegaz - the unit's full name - was that Yukos owed more than $27bn in back taxes for the years from 2000 onwards. Arbitration of the lawsuit could take place in Stockholm or The Hague, Mr Gaillard said. Yukos is still waiting to see what will happen to its filing in a US court for bankruptcy protection. Yukos claims its downfall was punishment for the political ambitions of its founder Mikhail Khodorkovsky.
