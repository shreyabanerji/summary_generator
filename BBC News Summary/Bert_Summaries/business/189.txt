Fiat chief takes steering wheel

The chief executive of the Fiat conglomerate has taken day-to-day control of its struggling car business in an effort to turn it around. Ferrari, in which Fiat owns a majority stake, could be separately floated on the stock market in either 2006 or 2007. The car business, best known for its Alfa Romeo marque, is expected to make a loss of about 800m euros in 2004.
