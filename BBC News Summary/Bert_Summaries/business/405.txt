House prices rebound says Halifax

UK house prices increased by 1.1% in December, the first monthly rise since September, the Halifax has said. The UK's biggest mortgage lender said prices rose 15.1% over the whole of 2004, but by only 2.8% in the second half of the year. The survey seems to fly in the face of recent evidence that the UK housing market has been slowing substantially in response to interest rate rises. Growth in unsecured lending, such as personal loans and credit cards, also slowed last month. Experts believe five interest rate rises since November 2003 are cutting borrowers' appetite for debt.
