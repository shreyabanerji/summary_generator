Japan turns to beer alternatives

Japanese brewers are increasingly making money from beer-flavoured drinks rather than beer itself

Beer and spirits are heavily taxed in Japan, driving breweries to search for alternatives. Now, according to Asahi Breweries, the market for so-called "beer-like" drinks is set to grow 84% this year. Happoshu has been a mainstay of brewery profits for years, taking over from beer thanks to its low tax and therefore low cost.
