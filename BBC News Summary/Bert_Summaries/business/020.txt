Call centre users 'lose patience'

Customers trying to get through to call centres are getting impatient and quicker to hang up, a survey suggests. One possible reason for the lack in patience, Ms Diemont says, is the fact that more customers are calling 'on the move' using their mobile phones. The surge in customers trying to get through to call centres is also a reflection of the centres' growing range of tasks. " This, Ms Diemont warns, is "scary" and not good for the bottom line either. You can make call centres perform anywhere if you have good management and the right processes in place," she says. Half of them argue that workers in other countries offer better skills for the money.
