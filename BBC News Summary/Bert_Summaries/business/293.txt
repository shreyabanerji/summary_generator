Glazer makes new Man Utd approach

Malcolm Glazer has made a fresh approach to buy Manchester United, which could lead to a bid valuing the Premiership club at Â£800m. Man United had turned down the bid because it was based on a high level of borrowing. But newspapers have speculated recently that the tycoon had gained the support of leading banks to come up with a stronger and less debt-laden bid.
