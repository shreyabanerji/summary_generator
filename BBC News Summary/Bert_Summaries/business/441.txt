Trade gap narrows as exports rise

The UK's trade gap narrowed in November, helped by a 7.5% rise in exports outside the European Union. The UK's deficit with the EU fell to £1.9bn from £2.1bn, while its non-EU shortfall dropped to £2.7bn from £2.9bn in October. The country's surplus on trade-in-services remained steady at £1.5bn for the fifth month in a row. But there is a danger that this could be held back by the ongoing weakness of domestic demand on the continent."
