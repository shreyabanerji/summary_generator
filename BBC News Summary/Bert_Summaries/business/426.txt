Minister hits out at Yukos sale

Russia's renationalisation of its energy industry needs to be reversed, a senior government figure has warned. On 28 December, another senior economic adviser called the sale "the swindle of the century". Yuganskneftegaz, the unit which produced 60% of Yukos' output, had been seized and sold in December for less than $10bn to a previously unknown firm called Baikal. And he warned that using back taxes to deal with firms like Yukos - a technique now being applied by the Kremlin to several other firms - was a mistake. " If we follow that logic, we should nationalise all businesses," he said.
