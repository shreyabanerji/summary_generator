US consumer confidence up

Consumers' confidence in the state of the US economy is at its highest for five months and they are optimistic about 2005, an influential survey says. The Conference Board survey of 5,000 households pointed to renewed optimism about job creation and economic growth. The overall US economy has performed strongly in recent months, prompting the Federal Reserve to increase interest rates five times since June.
