Quake's economic costs emerging

Asian governments and international agencies are reeling at the potential economic devastation left by the Asian tsunami and floods. Some early estimates of reconstruction costs are starting to emerge. Economists believe several of the 10 countries hit by the giant waves could see a slowdown in growth. Governments are expected to take steps, such as cutting taxes and increasing spending, to facilitate a recovery. In three months, we should rebuild 70% of the damage in the three worst hit provinces," said Juthamas Siriwan, governor of the Tourism Authority of Thailand.
