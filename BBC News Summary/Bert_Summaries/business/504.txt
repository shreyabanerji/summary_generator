Aids and climate top Davos agenda

Climate change and the fight against Aids are leading the list of concerns for the first day of the World Economic Forum in the Swiss resort of Davos. Earlier in the day came an update on efforts to have 3 million people on anti-Aids drugs by the end of 2005. The themes to be stressed by Mr Blair - whose attendance was announced at the last minute - are those he wants to dominate the UK's chairmanship of the G8 group of industrialised states. Unlike previous years, protests against the WEF are expected to be muted.
