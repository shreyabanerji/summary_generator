Market unfazed by Aurora setback

As the Aurora limped back to its dock on 20 January, a blizzard of photos and interviews seemed to add up to an unambiguous tale of woe. And its owner, P&O Cruises - now part of the huge US Carnival Corporation - was looking at a significant slice chopped off this year's profits and a potential PR fiasco. Similarly, analysts expect the impact on the rest of the cruise business to be limited. In the wake of P&O Princess's takeover by Carnival, the business is now to a great extent a duopoly. In other words, if you do want a cruise, your options are limited.
