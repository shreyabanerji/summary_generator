US budget deficit to reach $368bn

The US budget deficit is set to hit a worse-than-expected $368bn (Â£197bn) this year, officials said on Tuesday. In recent months, the dollar has weakened amid market jitters about the size of the budget and trade deficits. One of President George W Bush's election pledges was to halve the budget deficit within five years. On Tuesday, the US administration asked Congress for additional funds for military operations.
