Executive trio leave Aer Lingus

Three senior executives of Ireland's state-owned airline, Aer Lingus, are set to leave early on 28 January after accusations of a conflict of interest. They announced in November they would quit in May, but did not give a reason. Mr Walsh denied they had been forced out early because of the reports claiming they were set to launch a competitor airline. This week opposition politicians had called on the Irish government to make an urgent decision on the future of the airline.
