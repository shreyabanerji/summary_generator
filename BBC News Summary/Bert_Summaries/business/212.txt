MG Rover China tie-up 'delayed'

MG Rover's proposed tie-up with China's top carmaker has been delayed due to concerns by Chinese regulators, according to the Financial Times. As a result, hopes that approval of the deal may be fast-tracked have disappeared, the paper said. The paper said that Chinese officials believe cutbacks will be required to keep the MG Rover's costs in line with revenues.
