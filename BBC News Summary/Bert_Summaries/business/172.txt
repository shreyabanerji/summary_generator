Newest EU members underpin growth

The European Union's newest members will bolster Europe's economic growth in 2005, according to a new report. The global economy will slow in 2005, the UNECE forecasts, due to widespread weakness in consumer demand. Separately, the Bundesbank warned that Germany's efforts to reduce its budget deficit below 3% of GDP presented "huge risks" given that headline economic growth was set to fall below 1% this year. The orderly reversal of the deficit is a major challenge for policy makers in both the United States and other economies," it noted.
