Orange colour clash set for court

A row over the colour orange could hit the courts after mobile phone giant Orange launched action against a new mobile venture from Easyjet's founder. Orange claims the new low-cost mobile service has infringed its rights regarding the use of the colour orange and could confuse customers - known as "passing off". The new service is the latest venture from Easygroup, which includes a chain of internet cafes, budget car rentals and an intercity bus service.
