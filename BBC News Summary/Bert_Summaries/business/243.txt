Making your office work for you

Our mission to brighten up your working lives continues - and this time, we're taking a long hard look at your offices. Referring to the space as work will give those around you a clear message that this is professional space. Joining professional groups or forming a loose association of like-minded people may assist. It is useful to structure these meetings in advance as often they get relegated to less important status when times are busy - with the danger that when the workload eases, they have to be resurrected. Ideally, the roof should be replaced with an outer material in keeping with the character and location of the barn. This would also allow for a well-insulated inner skin to be provided which should be light coloured. Please click on the link to the right here to see my ideas for Marianne's barn. The layout of this office reflects the need to have a working area and a more relaxed meeting space. You may require an additional wireless access point in the renovated area.
