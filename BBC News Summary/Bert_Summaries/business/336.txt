Banker loses sexism claim

A former executive at the London offices of Merrill Lynch has lost her Â£7.5m ($14.6m) sex discrimination case against the US investment bank. The action - the biggest claim heard by an employment tribunal in the UK - had been viewed as something of a test case. Ms Villalba, the former head of Merrill's private client business in Europe, has made no decision on whether to appeal. The firm had told the tribunal that Ms Villalba's division had been losing about $1m a week.
