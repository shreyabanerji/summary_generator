Asia quake increases poverty risk

Nearly two million people across Asia could be thrown into poverty because of the Indian Ocean tsunami, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has said. In its first overview of the disaster, the ADB said the impact on economic growth would be slight because major cities and factories escaped damage. Other countries believe their economies are strong enough to cope or wish to avoid being viewed as credit risks. " Donor nations have promised to give $717m (Â£379m) in disaster relief over the next six months, according to the United Nations. This is a profoundly tragic event for the region and for the millions who are suffering.
