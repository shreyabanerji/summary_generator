WMC says Xstrata bid is too low

Australian mining firm WMC Resources has said it is worth up to 30% more than a hostile 7.4bn Australian dollar ($5.8bn; There is now pressure on Swiss-based Xstrata to increase its takeover offer. We will review the information contained in the target's statement over the next week or so." And WMC chief executive Andrew Michelmore claimed the Xstrata offer was aimed at creating value for Xstrata's shareholders, and was not being made for the benefit of WMC's shareholders.
