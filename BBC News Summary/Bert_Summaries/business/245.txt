The 'ticking budget' facing the US

The budget proposals laid out by the administration of US President George W Bush are highly controversial. Some will recall the news footage of angry farmers driving their heavy equipment around the US Capitol in the late 1970s. In addition, the United States has two significant military missions. Reducing domestic spending, or eliminating "waste, fraud and abuse" is toothless because this slice of the budget is too small to solve the problem. It's fantasy to think these routine government functions could be slashed. Savings in health care spending that do not come at the expense of health can only be achieved with wholesale reform of the entire system, public and private. On the revenue side, the lion's share of revenue lost to tax cuts enacted since 2000 will have to be replaced. One thing is certain - destroying the budget in order to save it is not going to equip the US economy and government for the challenges of this new century.
