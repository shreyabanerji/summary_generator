Worldcom director ends evidence

The former chief financial officer at US telecoms firm WorldCom has finished giving evidence at the trial of his ex-boss Bernie Ebbers. Mr Ebbers is on trial for fraud and conspiracy in relation to WorldCom's collapse in 2002. The former finance officer said Mr Ebbers knew about the improper accounting entries that were made between 2000 and 2002 to conceal soaring expenses and inflate revenue.
