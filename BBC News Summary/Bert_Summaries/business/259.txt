Latin America sees strong growth

Latin America's economy grew by 5.5% in 2004, its best performance since 1980, while exports registered their best performance in two decades. Nevertheless, the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) still forecasts growth of 4% for 2005. ECLAC also said that the six largest Latin American economies (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Venezuela) grew by more than 3% for only the second time in 20 years.
