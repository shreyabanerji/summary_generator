BT offers equal access to rivals

BT has moved to pre-empt a possible break-up of its business by offering to cut wholesale broadband prices and open its network to rivals. BT wants lighter regulation in exchange for the changes, as well as the removal of the break-up threat. It added that it plans to invest Â£10bn in the next five years to create a "21st Century network". Chris Panayis, managing director of ISP Freedom2surf said that it would make the situation clearer for business. " This is a reminder to Ofcom that as long as BT can change the dynamics of the whole broadband market at will, the process of opening up the UK's local telephone network to infrastructure investment and competition remains fragile," a spokesman said. " More than 100 telecom firms, consumer groups and other interested parties are expected to make submissions to the regulator during this consultation phase.
