Boeing secures giant Japan order

Boeing is to supply Japan Airlines with up to 50 of its forthcoming 7E7 planes in a deal that could be worth as much as $6bn (Â£3.1bn) for the US giant. Asia's biggest airline joins Japanese rival All Nippon as one of the first carriers to order the mid-size 7E7, which Boeing says is super-economical. The 7E7 fits better for what we needed and it could be delivered when we hoped to get it."
