Fed chief warning on US deficit

Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan has warned that allowing huge US budget deficits to continue could have "severe" consequences. While the US economy is growing at a "reasonably good pace" he warned that budget concerns were clouding the economic outlook for the US. If existing promises need to be changed, those changes should be made sooner rather than later," Mr Greenspan said. He also urged Congress to reinstate lapsed rules that require tax cuts and spending to be offset elsewhere in the budget in an effort to prevent the US heading further into the red.
