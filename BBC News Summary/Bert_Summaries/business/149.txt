Saab to build Cadillacs in Sweden

General Motors, the world's largest car maker, has confirmed that it will build a new medium-sized Cadillac BLS at its loss-making Saab factory in Sweden. As part of its efforts to make the US marque appeal to European drivers, the car will be the first Cadillac with a diesel engine. The factory in Trollhaettan has been at the centre of rumours about GM's planned severe cutbacks in its troubled European operations. GM's plans to build the American marque in Sweden is part of its efforts to push it as an alternative luxury brand for European drivers. Beyond the 12,000 job cuts announced last year at its European operations, GM is reducing expenditure by building Saabs, Opels - badged as Vauxhalls in the UK - and now Cadillacs on the same framework, and by allowing the different brands to share parts.
