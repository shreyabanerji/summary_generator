Giving financial gifts to children

Your child or grandchild may want the latest toy this Christmas, but how about giving them a present that will help their financial future? It may encourage children to save or start a fund which could count towards university costs, for example. As the Child Trust Fund will not be in force in time for Christmas, relatives could invest their gifts in a higher rate children's deposit account, and use this as a feeder fund. Some of the best instant-access accounts currently available include the Ladybird account from the Saffron Walden Building Society, paying 5.35% for a minimum balance of £1 and the Alliance & Leicester FirstSaver which pays 5.25%, also starting at £1. If the account holds money gifted by friends and relatives - but not parents - any interest earned from the savings account may be set against the allowance. These are pooled investment funds which give access to a wide range of shares. Exchange Traded Funds offer an alternative way to track a stock market.
