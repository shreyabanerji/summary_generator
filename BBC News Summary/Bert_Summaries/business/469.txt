IMF agrees fresh Turkey funding

Turkey has agreed a draft proposal with the International Monetary Fund to borrow $10bn (Â£5.19bn), extending its ongoing financial support until 2007. Turkey's current $18.6bn loan agreement with the IMF expires in February and the new deal would see it receive added support between 2005 and 2007. Turkey's economy has steadily recovered from a severe crisis in 2001. The EU will decide on 17 December whether to begin entry talks with Turkey.
