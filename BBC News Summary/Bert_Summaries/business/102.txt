US company admits Benin bribery

A US defence and telecommunications company has agreed to pay $28.5m after admitting bribery in the West African state of Benin. Titan, a California-based company, pleaded guilty to falsifying its accounts and violating US anti-bribery laws. Some of the money was used to pay for T-shirts with campaign slogans on them ahead of the 2001 election.
