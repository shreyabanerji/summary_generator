French wine gets 70m euro top-up

The French government is to hand its struggling wine industry 70m euros ($91m) in aid to help it battle falling sales and damaging overproduction. France fell behind the 'New World' producers of Australia, Chile and the United States for the first time in 2003 in terms of exports. However, wine makers and farmers said the support was much less than they had been hoping for. " In an effort to tackle overcapacity, the government will agree that vines can be destroyed in areas where growers give their unanimous consent, while 500 vintners will be helped to take early retirement.
