China Aviation seeks rescue deal

Scandal-hit jet fuel supplier China Aviation Oil has offered to repay its creditors $220m (Â£117m) of the $550m it lost on trading in oil futures. The firm said it hoped to pay $100m now and another $120m over eight years. The trading scandal is the biggest to hit Singapore since the $1.2bn collapse of Barings Bank in 1995.
