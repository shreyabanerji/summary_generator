Israel looks to US for bank chief

Israel has asked a US banker and former International Monetary Fund director to run its central bank. Stanley Fischer, vice chairman of banking giant Citigroup, has agreed to take the Bank of Israel job subject to approval from parliament and cabinet. At the World Bank in 1985, he participated in drawing up an economic stabilisation package for Israel.
