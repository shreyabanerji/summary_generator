Fosters buys stake in winemaker

Australian brewer Fosters has bought a large stake in Australian winemaker Southcorp, sparking rumours of a possible takeover. Fosters said it was currently in discussions "which may lead to a major corporate announcement". Robert Oatley and his son Sandy Oatley have both resigned from Southcorp's board following the share deal. Since then, it has paid $1bn for US wine maker Robert Mondavi, bought last month. Analysts were divided on Thursday about whether Fosters was more likely to go for a takeover or merely wanted to take a big enough chunk of Southcorp to prevent it falling to a rival. "
