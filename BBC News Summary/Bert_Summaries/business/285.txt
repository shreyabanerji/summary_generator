EU 'too slow' on economic reforms

Most EU countries have failed to put in place policies aimed at making Europe the world's most competitive economy by the end of the decade, a report says. In 2000, EU leaders at a summit in Lisbon pledged the European economy would outstrip that of the US by 2010. Among the biggest laggards, according to the report, are Greece and Italy.
