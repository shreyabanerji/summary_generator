Argentina closes $102.6bn debt swap

Argentina is set to close its $102.6bn (Â£53.51bn) debt restructuring offer for bondholders later on Friday, with the government hopeful that most creditors will accept the deal. The estimated loss to bondholders is up to 70% of the original value of the bonds, yet the majority are expected to accept the government's offer. By 18 February, creditors holding $41bn - or 40% of the total debt - had accepted the offer.
