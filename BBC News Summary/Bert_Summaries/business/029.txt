UK firm faces Venezuelan land row

Venezuelan authorities have said they will seize land owned by a British company as part of President Chavez's agrarian reform programme. Prosecutors in the south of the country have targeted Hato El Charcote, a beef cattle ranch owned by Agroflora. The Vestey Group said it had owned the land since 1920 and would co-operate fully with the authorities.
