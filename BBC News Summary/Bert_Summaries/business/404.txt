Continental 'may run out of cash'

Shares in Continental Airlines have tumbled after the firm warned it could run out of cash. In a filing to US regulators the airline warned of "inadequate liquidity" if it fails to reduce wage costs by $500m by the end of February. Airlines have faced tough conditions in recent years, amid terrorism fears since the 11 September World Trade Centre attack in 2001.
