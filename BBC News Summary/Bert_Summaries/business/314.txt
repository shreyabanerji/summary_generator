Yukos unit fetches $9bn at auction

A little-known Russian company has bought the main production unit of oil giant Yukos at auction in Moscow. Â£4.8bn) for Yugansk - nowhere near the $27bn Russia says Yukos owes in taxes. Meanwhile, Tim Osborne, head of Yukos main shareholders' group Menatep, said that Yukos may have to declare itself bankrupt, and that legal action would be taken, outside Russia, against the auction winners. Yukos has always insisted the auction was state-sponsored theft but Russian authorities argued they were imposing the law, trying to recover billions in unpaid taxes. And, according to Tass news agency, Gazprom did not make a single bid, leaving the way open for Baikal, which paid above the auction start price of 246.75bn roubles. I see no plausible explanation for the theory that Baikal was representing competing interests. " Yukos says those tax demands are exorbitant, and had sought refuge in US courts.
