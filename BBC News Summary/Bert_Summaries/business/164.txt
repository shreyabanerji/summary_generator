Yukos sues four firms for $20bn

Russian oil firm Yukos has sued four companies for their role in last year's forced state auction of its key oil production unit Yuganskneftegas. As well as suing for damages, Yukos has asked the US court to send its tax dispute with the Russian government to an international arbitrator. Yukos called the sale illegal and has turned to courts in the US in an effort to regain control of the oil production business. Yukos claims that the rights of its shareholders have been ignored and that is has been punished for the political ambitions of its founder Mikhail Khodorkovsky.
