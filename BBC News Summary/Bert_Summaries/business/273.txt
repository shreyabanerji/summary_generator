Markets fall on weak dollar fears

Rising oil prices and the sinking dollar hit shares on Monday after a finance ministers' meeting and stern words from Fed chief Alan Greenspan. G20 finance ministers said nothing about supporting the dollar, whose slide could further jeopardise growth in Japan and Europe. But he also said that the rate was entirely up to the markets - a signal which traders took as advice to sell the dollar. But in a speech on Friday, Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan warned that in the longer term things are likely to get tricky.
