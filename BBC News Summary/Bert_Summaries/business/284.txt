Iraqi voters turn to economic issues

Beyond the desperate security situation in Iraq lies an economy in tatters. So there is much hope that an elected government will break the deadlock. " Mr Hadi's view about what the new government's priorities should be is shared by many Iraqis. But some progress has been made, largely thanks to the country's oil revenues which have exceeded $22bn since June 2003. But the involvement of foreign firms in the health and banking sectors and beyond sits uneasily with many Iraqis who are accustomed to the state taking responsibility for functions that are essential to making society work, observes Ms Alexander. " Consequently, the transitional government has been forced to backtrack in recent months over its proposal to allow 100% foreign ownership of Iraqi assets, she explains. Iraq's vast natural resources can support any magnitude of economic growth."
