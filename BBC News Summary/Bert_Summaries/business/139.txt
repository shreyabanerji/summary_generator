German jobless rate at new record

More than 5.2 million Germans were out of work in February, new figures show. Widely leaked to the German newspapers a day in advance, they produced screaming headlines criticising Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's Social Democrat-Green Party administration. Still, some measures suggest the picture is not quite so bleak. Using the most internationally-accepted methodology of the International Labour Organisation (ILO), Germany had 3.97 million people out of work in January.
