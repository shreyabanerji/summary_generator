Business confidence dips in Japan

Business confidence among Japanese manufacturers has weakened for the first time since March 2003, the quarterly Tankan survey has found. Slower economic growth, rising oil prices, a stronger yen and weaker exports were blamed for the fall. Japan's economy grew by just 0.1% in the three months to September, according revised data issued this month. The dollar's decline has strengthened the yen, making Japanese exports more expensive in the US.
