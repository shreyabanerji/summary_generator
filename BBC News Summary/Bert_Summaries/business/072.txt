S Korean consumers spending again

South Korea looks set to sustain its revival thanks to renewed private consumption, its central bank says. It had cut rates in November to help revive the economy, but rising inflation - reaching 0.7% month-on-month in January - has stopped it from cutting further. Other indicators are also suggesting that the country is inching back towards economic health.
