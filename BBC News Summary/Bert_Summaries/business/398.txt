Tsunami to cost Sri Lanka $1.3bn

Sri Lanka faces a $1.3bn (Â£691m) bill in 2005 for reconstruction after the tsunami which killed more than 30,000 of its people, its central bank says. A full reckoning of the economic cost to Sri Lanka of the tsunami will not be clear for some time to come. One side-effect of the disaster has been that the value of the rupee has risen as foreign funds have flooded into the country.
