Qantas considers offshore option

Australian airline Qantas could transfer as many as 7,000 jobs out of its home country as it seeks to save costs, according to newspaper reports. In a statement, Qantas said it was looking to build its operations overseas. Unions reacted angrily to the reported disclosure, arguing that Qantas was profitable and did not need to take such action. " In an effort to meet the challenge posed by low cost carriers, Qantas sought a tie-up with Air New Zealand last year However, the deal was thrown out by the New Zealand High Court on competition grounds.
