Business fears over sluggish EU economy

As European leaders gather in Rome on Friday to sign the new EU constitution, many companies will be focusing on matters much closer to home - namely how to stay in business. Like northern England and industrial Scotland, those industries have been in long term decline - the last coal pit closed in 1990. Director Hugues Charbonnier says he is under pressure because factories in the Far East are able to make some of his output more cheaply, while his key markets are now in China and India. " He much preferred the old currencies of Europe, which moved in relation to each country's economic performance. With Germany making up a third of the eurozone's economy, this is a major problem. Factory manager Herbert Stueker says that he now hopes to increase productivity "by nearly 30%". If we could solve that problem we could cut unemployment by half," he says.
