Palestinian economy in decline

Despite a short-lived increase in Palestinian jobs in 2003, the economy is performing well below its potential, said a World Bank report. An Assessment, there is a close link between the number of closures - both border closures and internal closures between cities - and Palestinian economic problems. The report said even more would be on the poverty line without an average of $950m a year from international donors, some of which goes towards job creation.
