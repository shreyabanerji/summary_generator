G7 backs Africa debt relief plan

G7 finance ministers have backed plans to write off up to 100% of the debts of some of the world's poorest countries. Mr Brown said it was a major breakthrough for the international organisations to offer up to 100% multilateral debt relief - "the vast bulk" of money owed by the poorest countries. But he said they would insist on government reforms and the need for transparency, tackling corruption and openness from both the poorest and richest nations. They need to move quickly to turn their proposals into real change for the world's poorest. " Mr Brown said it was "winning support every day" and said a programme had been agreed to draw up more details in time for the G8 summit in July. But this particular mechanism does not work for the United States. At a dinner on Friday night, former South African president Nelson Mandela backed Mr Brown's plan when he urged the finance chiefs to write-off African debt and provide an extra $50bn (Â£26.69bn) a year in aid for the next decade.
