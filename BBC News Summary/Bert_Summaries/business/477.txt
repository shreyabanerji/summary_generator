JP Morgan admits US slavery links

Thousands of slaves were accepted as collateral for loans by two banks that later became part of JP Morgan Chase. Citizens Bank and Canal Bank are the two lenders that were identified. The bank said that it is a "very different company than the Citizens and Canal Banks of the 1800s".
