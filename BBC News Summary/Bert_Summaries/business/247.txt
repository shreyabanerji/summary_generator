Renault boss hails 'great year'

Strong sales outside western Europe helped Renault boost its profits by more than 40% in 2004 although the firm warned of lower margins this year. The firm said strong demand outside western Europe and the good performance of its Megane range lifted its results. Growth came mainly from outside western Europe, with particularly strong sales in Turkey, Russia and North Africa.
