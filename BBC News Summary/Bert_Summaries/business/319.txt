Euronext joins bid battle for LSE

Pan-European stock market Euronext has approached the London Stock Exchange (LSE) about a possible takeover bid. Further reports had suggested that Euronext could make an offer in excess of the LSE's 533p a share closing price on Friday. There has been extensive speculation about a possible takeover of the company since an attempted merger with Deutsche Boerse failed in 2000.
