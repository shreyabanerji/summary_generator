Indian oil firm eyes Yukos assets

India's biggest oil exploration firm, Oil & Natural Gas Corp (ONGC), says it is in talks to buy the former assets of troubled Russian crude producer Yukos. State-owned Rosneft now owns Yugansk and Russia has said it will turn the oil producer into a stand-alone firm. India produces about 793,000 barrels of oil per day (bpd), little changed since the start of the 1990s, according to oil industry analysts Douglas-Westwood. Consumption, meanwhile, has jumped to 2.4 million bpd, compared with 474,000 bpd in 1973. India is a "dramatically growing economy that must have access to oil". On Thursday, a US court said it will hear arguments for Yukos' bankruptcy claim to be thrown out on 16 February.
