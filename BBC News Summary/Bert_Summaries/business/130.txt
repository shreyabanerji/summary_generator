Aviation firms eye booming India

India's defence minister has opened the country's Aero India 2005 air show with an invitation for global aerospace firms to outsource jobs to the nation. More than 240 civil and military aerospace firms from 31 countries are attending the show. In fact, it is the first time the US Air Force will attend the air show since sanctions imposed in 1998 after India's nuclear tests were lifted. The airline, SpiceJet, will also have the option to acquire 10 more aircraft.
