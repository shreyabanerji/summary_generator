India and Iran in gas export deal

India has signed a $40bn (Â£21bn) deal to import millions of tonnes of liquefied natural gas from Iran. The announcement comes as ONGC said it was in talks to buy former assets of troubled Russian oil firm Yukos. Iran - Opec's second-biggest oil producer and one of the world's top gas producers - has been pursuing a series of deals, rewarding LNG buyers with participation in development of its oil fields.
