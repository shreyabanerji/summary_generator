Giant waves damage S Asia economy

Governments, aid agencies, insurers and travel firms are among those counting the cost of the massive earthquake and waves that hammered southern Asia. Early estimates from the World Bank put the amount of aid needed at about $5bn (Â£2.6bn), similar to the cash offered Central America after Hurricane Mitch. Mitch killed about 10,000 people and caused damage of about $10bn in 1998. World Bank spokesman Damien Milverton told the Wall Street Journal that he expected an aid package of financing and debt relief. In the Maldives islands, in the Indian ocean, two-thirds of all jobs depend on tourism. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has promised rapid action to help the governments of the stricken countries cope. It is too early for us to state what our financial burden will be."
