Trial begins of Spain's top banker

The trial of Emilio Botin, the chairman of Spain's most powerful bank, Santander Central Hispano, has started in Madrid. In spite of the allegations against him, Mr Botin continues to lead Santander, and was instrumental in the Â£8.5bn takeover last November of the British bank Abbey National. Since taking over the chairmanship in 1986, he has turned Santander into one of the top ten biggest banks in the world.
