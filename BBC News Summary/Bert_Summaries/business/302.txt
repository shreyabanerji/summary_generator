Cactus diet deal for Phytopharm

A slimming aid made from a southern African cactus is set to be developed by UK firm Phytopharm and Unilever. Studies have reportedly shown the plant curbs appetite instead of reducing calorific intake like many existing products. The firm had initially hoped to market a slimming drug from Hoodia with Pfizer.
