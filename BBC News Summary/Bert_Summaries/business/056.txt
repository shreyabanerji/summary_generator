BMW drives record sales in Asia

BMW has forecast sales growth of at least 10% in Asia this year after registering record sales there in 2004. BMW sold nearly 95,000 cars in Asia last year, up 2.6% on 2003. However, BMW is hopeful of a much better year in 2005 as its direct investment in China begins to pay dividends.
