Ban on forced retirement under 65

Employers will no longer be able to force workers to retire before 65, unless they can justify it. The government has announced that firms will be barred from 2006 from imposing arbitrary retirement ages. Employers have the ability to define the end point of the employer-employee relationship and employees have flexibility with a right to request to work past the age of 65."
