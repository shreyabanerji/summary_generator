Japanese mogul arrested for fraud

One of Japan's best-known businessmen was arrested on Thursday on charges of falsifying shareholder information and selling shares based on the false data. He used his wealth and influence to bring the Winter Olympic Games to Nagano in 1998. Now Mr Tsutsumi faces criminal charges and the possibility of a prison sentence because he made it look as if the 10 biggest shareholders owned less than this amount. There have been corporate governance issues at some other Japanese companies too.
