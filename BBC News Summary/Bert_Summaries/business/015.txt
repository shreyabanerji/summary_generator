Air passengers win new EU rights

Air passengers who are unable to board their flights because of overbooking, cancellations or flight delays can now demand greater compensation. Previously, passengers could claim between 150 euros and 300 euros if they had been stopped from boarding. When this happens against a passenger's will, airlines will now have to offer compensation. However, airlines do not have to offer compensation if flights are cancelled or delayed due to "extraordinary circumstances". Low-cost airlines have criticised the new compensation levels, arguing that the pay-out could be worth more than the ticket. " Andy Clarke, ERAA director of air transport, said that the EC advice misleads customers as it leads them to believe that airlines could be liable for payouts if flights are delayed because of bad weather.
