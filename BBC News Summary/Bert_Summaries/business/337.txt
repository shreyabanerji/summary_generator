Building giant in asbestos payout

Australian building products group James Hardie has agreed to pay $1.1bn (Â£568m) to victims of asbestos-related diseases. The landmark deal could see thousands of people suffering from lung diseases - caused by asbestos the company once made - receive compensation. In September, the inquiry found that the company had misled the public about the amount of money set aside to cover its asbestos-related liabilities, sparking the resignation of its then chief executive, Peter MacDonald. At the end of the day we are dealing with compensation for people who are terminally ill.
