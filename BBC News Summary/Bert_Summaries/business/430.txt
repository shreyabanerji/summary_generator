US prepares for hybrid onslaught

Sales of hybrid cars in the US are set to double in 2005, research suggests. Hybrids cut both petrol consumption and emissions by combining a petrol engine with an electric motor constantly kept charged by extra engine power. Toyota has led the market to date with the Prius, popularised by a number of celebrities keen to burnish their "green" credentials. Ford, which has sold 4,000 of its first hybrid since its launch in August, is bringing a hybrid SUV - the Mariner - to market a year ahead of schedule, with plans for three more models by 2008.
