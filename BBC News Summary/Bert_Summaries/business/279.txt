German bidder in talks with LSE

Deutsche Boerse bosses have held "constructive, professional and friendly" talks with the London Stock Exchange (LSE), its chief has said. Ahead of talks with the LSE on Friday, the pan-European bourse said it may be prepared to make its offer in cash. However, neither side has made a formal offer for the LSE, with sources claiming such a step may still be weeks away. Deutsche Boerse could also face mounting opposition to a bid at home.
