Ford gains from finance not cars

Ford, the US car company, reported higher fourth quarter and full-year profits on Thursday boosted by a buoyant period for its car loans unit. "We also confronted operating challenges with our Jaguar brand and high industry marketing costs," he added. Total company vehicle unit sales in 2004 were 6,798,000, an increase of 62,000 units from 2003. For the full year, Ford's worldwide automotive division earned a pre-tax profit of $850m, a $697m improvement from $153m a year ago.
