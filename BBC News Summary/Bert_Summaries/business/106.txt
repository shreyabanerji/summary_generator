Golden rule 'intact' says ex-aide

Chancellor Gordon Brown will meet his golden economic rule "with a margin to spare", according to his former chief economic adviser. Formerly one of Mr Brown's closest Treasury aides, Ed Balls hinted at a Budget giveaway on 16 March. Prime Minister Tony Blair has yet to name the date of the election, but most pundits are betting on 5 May as the likely day.
