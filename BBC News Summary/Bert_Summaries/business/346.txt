Disaster claims 'less than $10bn'

Insurers have sought to calm fears that they face huge losses after an earthquake and giant waves killed at least 38,000 people in southern Asia. Munich Re and Swiss Re, the world's two biggest reinsurers, have said exposure will be less than for other disasters. The region's resorts and Western tourists are expected to be among the main claimants. A spokeswoman for Hanover Re, Europe's fifth-largest reinsurance firm, estimated tsunami-related damage claims would be in the low double-digit millions of euros. Zurich Financial said they could not yet assess the cost of the disaster. Tourists cutting short their holidays in affected areas may suffer a financial impact too.
