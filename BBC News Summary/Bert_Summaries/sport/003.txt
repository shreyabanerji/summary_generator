Greene sets sights on world title

Maurice Greene aims to wipe out the pain of losing his Olympic 100m title in Athens by winning a fourth World Championship crown this summer. He had to settle for bronze in Greece behind fellow American Justin Gatlin and Francis Obikwelu of Portugal. " But Greene believes he lost the race and his title in the semi-finals. " I believe if I was in the middle of the race I would have been able to react to people that came ahead of me."
