Uganda bans Vagina Monologues

Uganda's authorities have banned the play The Vagina Monologues, due to open in the capital, Kampala this weekend. The Ugandan Media Council said the performance would not be put on as it promoted and glorified acts such as lesbianism and homosexuality. But the work's author, US playwright Eve Ensler, says it is all about women's empowerment. " It's not a slang word or dirty word it's a biological, anatomical word."
