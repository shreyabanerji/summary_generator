thank you must present your before .the problem .today the nation more and so genuine American here on .as most of you know Rosa Parks died yesterday in a role in Detroit .to refresh and by her example .Rosa Parks help lay the foundation for a country that could begin to live up to its creative .for life and a brave actions reminded each and everyone of us and my personal responsibility .to stand up for what's rate .and the central truth of the American experience that our greatness as a nation derives from seemingly ordinary people doing extraordinary thanks .well the box life was a lesson in perseverance .as a child she grew up listening to the cook likes plan right by her house fearing that our house would be broken down .in a small town in Alabama she attended a one room school for African American children that only went through the second grade .when she moved to Montgomery Alabama to continue her schooling she was forced to clean classrooms after score to pay your tuition .although she attended Alabama state teachers college Rosa Parks would like later make a living as a seems stress and housekeeper my chi didn't accept better opportunities were limited to sign clothes or cleaning house .in a forties Rosa Parks was appointed secretary of my gumtree branch of the end of laci P. and was active and bottom registration drives with the Montgomery moderate leaf .in the summer of nineteen fifty five she attended the Highlander folk school where she took classes in workers rights and racial equality .well before she made the headlines across the country .she was a highly respected member of of my gumtree community and a committed member of of the civil rights African .of course %HESITATION name became probably actually in American history on December first nineteen fifty five when she was arrested for refusing to give up received to wait passenger on a Montgomery bus .but what's not none of well known is that it wasn't the first time Rosa Parks refused to acquiesce to the gym processed .the same must rub %HESITATION had a address arrested .and how troops drawn off the bus bad they had done the same year before when Rosa Parks refused to go up receipts .some school children atop the roles approached refused to give up received because I think we're tired .but I. nation school books are only getting half rate .most parts once said the only tired I was was tired of giving it .the solitary act of civil disobedience became a called action .for arrest led to .abandon relatively unknown pastor .my looking junior to organise a bus boy car for the entire my gumtree sister .the boy car lasted three hundred and eighty one days and carbonated in a landmark Supreme Court decision finding that the fed is segregation policies were unconstitutional .this solitary act of civil disobedience was also the spark that ignited the beginning of the app for segregation and inspired millions around the country and ultimately around the world to get involved in the fight for racial equality .Rosa Parks persistence and determination tonight and that then the gumtree nor did it and with the passage of the Civil Rights Act and avoiding rates actors later .she stayed active in the end of laci P. and other still rates groups three years from nineteen sixty five to nineteen eighty eight most parts continued a public service by working

president Bill Clinton who awarded her the nation's highest honour for us a valiant the congressional gold medal .as we are the life of Rosa Parks we should not limit or commemoration to laughter you legit .instead let us come out to carry on replaced once sold very active time and ensure that our passion continues to expose inspires a better half century ago .bad in my view is how we can best banker for amounts cards revisions to our country .in closing Mr president Rosa Parks once said .as long as there is unemployment war crime and all the things that goal to the inflexion of man's inhumanity to man .regardless there is much to be done and people need to work together .now that she's passed it's up to us to make sure that her messages shared .for a while we will miss her cherish spirit .let's make sure to ensure that our legacy lives on in the hearts of the nation Mr president as a personal note .I think it is fair to assume that were it not for .bad quiet moment of courage my most products .I would not stand here before you today .I always heard great banks ours does the nation she will be sorely missed .thank you must present your before
