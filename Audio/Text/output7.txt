.that work starts today because the truth is we do not have a minute to waste .right now I can't be is trapped in a vicious cycle .the time well on Wall Street means in a round of belt tightening for families and businesses on main street and it's fox produced less and consume less about just beeping the problems in our financial markets is extraordinary stresses on our financial system require extraordinary policy responses in my administration will honour the public commitments made by the current administration to address this place .further beyond any immediate actions we may take we need a recovery plan for both Wall Street and main street a plan that's people opens our financial system and get credit flowing again while at the same time addressing or drawing for closure process helping or struggling auto industry and creating and saving two point five million jobs jobs rebuilding our infrastructure our roads our bridges modernising our schools and creating the clean energy infrastructure of the twenty first century because of this moment we need to restore both carpet is in the market and restore a car for them so of middle class families will find themselves working harder running west and falling further and further behind .about my economic team to develop recommendations for this plan and complete with current risk the current administration and the federal reserve on immediate economic development over the next two months I requested to be brief me on these matters on a daily basis and in the coming weeks I will provide the American people and the incoming time risk with an overview of the initial recommendations it is my hope that the new car it's will begin work on an aggressive economic recovery plan when they convene in early January but I. administration can hit the ground running .when I record me and distress we cannot have a take and we cannot delay or family can't afford to keep on waiting and hoping for a solution they can't afford to watch another month of unpaid bills pile up another semester of tuition without of reach another month where instead of saving for retirement the dipping into their savings just to get by .I want to repeat this will not be easy there are no shortcuts or quick fixes to this crisis which has been many years in the making and the car is likely to get worse before it gets better for recovery will not happen immediately and to make the investments we need we'll have to scour our federal budget line by line and make meaningful cuts and sacrifices as well something I'll be discussing further tomorrow .despite all of this I am hopeful about the future I have for companies in the wisdom and ingenuity of my economic team and in the hard work courage and sacrifice of the American people .most of all I believe deeply in the resilience .and the spirit of this make sure I know we can work our way out of this crisis because we've done it before and I know we will succeed once again if we put the blood products and shipping politics and work together that's exactly what I intend billed as president of the United States
