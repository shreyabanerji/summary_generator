thank you very much everybody governments you thank you all of you for the great work that you're doing and thank you were scheduling to billions for the outstanding work that she's doing %HESITATION making sure that millions of Americans can get health insurance thank you for .good morning everybody .it meant I last night for the first time in seventeen years .Republicans in Congress chose to shut down the federal government .won't be more specific one faction of one party in one house of Congress in one branch of government .shut down major parts of the government .I'll because they didn't like one loss .this Republican shut down did not have to happen .but I want every American .I understand why it did happen .Republicans in the house of representatives refused to find the government unless we be funded or dismantled before more correct .they've shut down the government over an ideological crusade to deny affordable health insurance to millions of Americans .in other words they demanded ransom just renewing the job .and many representatives including an increasing number of Republicans have made it clear that had they been allowed by speaker manner to take a simple up or down vote on keeping the government open would not partisan strings attached .enough faults from both parties would have kept the American people's government open an operator .we may not know the following pact of this Republican shut down for some time there will depend on how long it lasts but we do know a couple of thanks bye we know that the last time Republicans shut down the government in nineteen ninety six in order to cut me .and unlike the eighteen ninety six okay I'm still recovering from the worst recession in generations .we know that certain services and benefits but America seniors and veterans and business owners depend on .must be put on hold .so no officers along with every national park in my name it must be closed .and while last night I signed legislation to make sure a one point four million active duty military or paid through the shut down .hundreds of thousands of civilian workers small .any still on the job many forced to stay home are being paid .even if their family support and local businesses that rely on and we know about the longer the shutdown continues the worse the effects will be more families will be heard .more businesses will be harmed .so once again I already house Republicans to reopen the government .restart the services Americans depend on and allow the public service for men sent home to return to work .there's only going to happen when Republicans realised they don't get the whole the entire economy hostage or radiological demands .love said repeatedly I am prepared to work with Democrats and Republicans to do the things we need to build to grow the economy and create jobs and get our fiscal house in order over the long run .although I should add the shutdown isn't about deficits or spending or budget so .after all our deficits are falling at the fastest pace in fifty years .we've cut them in half since I took office .in fact many of the demands the Republicans are now making would actually raise our deficits .smell the shut down is not about deficits it's not about by just the shutdown is about rolling back or a bridge to provide health insurance defaulted on how to .it's all about rolling back the affordable Care Act .best more than anything else seems to be what the Republican Party stands for these days .I know it's strange that one party would make keeping people uninsured the centrepiece of their agenda .most bad apparently is what it is .and of course what stranger still is that shutting down the government .doesn't accomplish their stated goal .before my character is a lot of personal house it passed the Senate the Supreme Court rules constitutional it was a central issue in last year's election it is settled and it is here it to stay .and because of its funding sources it's not impacted by a government shut down .and these Americans are here with me today because even though the government is closed a big part of the affordable Care Act is now open for business .and programme and millions like them this is a historic day for a good reason .it's been a long time coming .but today Americans who have been forced to go without insurance can now visit health care dot gov and enrol in affordable new plans that offer quality coverage bad starts today and people have six months to sign up .so relax six months people are going to have the opportunity many times and in many cases for the first time in their lives .to get affordable coverage that they desperately need .now for secure one of the eighty five percent of Americans who already have health insurance you don't need to do a thing you're already benefiting from new benefits and protections that are made in place for some time under this loss .but for the fifteen percent of Americans who don't have health insurance .this opportunity is like change .I'm just tell the folks a few storeys that are represented here today two years ago amount of merit left a job in New York to take care of repairs and for a while she had temporary insurance the coverage or multiple sclerosis .when it expired many insurers won't cover it because rams us .J. love paying twelve hundred dollars a month it's nowhere near affordable or starting today she can get coverage for much less .because today is no plan can't use your medical history to charge you more than anybody else .sky high premiums once for Samantha bigger to choose between paying rent or paying for health insurance she's been uninsured every sense .so she pays all the medical bills out of park it was someone a credit card making them even harder to pay .Nancy says they talk about those who fall through the cracks I fell through the cracks ten years ago and I've been stuck there every sense well starting today Nancy can get coverage just like everybody else .phrase Edwards was later from a job a year ago today six months ago she was diagnosed with a brain tumour .you can afford insurance on the individual market so she has received treatment yet .for data limits but that's still not the university mount Maryland is considering dropping out of school to help pay for months bills .not starting today thanks to the affordable character needs can get coverage without forcing her daughter to give up on her groups .so the storeys .%HESITATION of homework in American sound familiar to you well during the day you and your friends and your family your call workers can get coverage to just visit health care dot gov and there you can compare insurance plans side by side the same way you show up for a plane ticket on kayak for a TV on Amazon .yeah %HESITATION some basic information you'll be presented with a less doesn't slowly affordable plans that are available in your area was clear descriptions of what each plan covers and what it will cost you'll find more choices more competition and in many cases lower prices most uninsured Americans will find that they can get coverage for a hundred dollars or less you don't have to take my word for it go on the website how could I go check it up yourself and then show it to your family your friends and help them get coverage just like mayors and churches and community groups and companies are already fanning out to do it across the country .and there is a hotline where you can apply over the phone and get help with the application .what else yep questions the answered my real people and R. and fifty different languages let me give you that number the number is one eight hundred three one eight two five nine six one eight hundred three one eight two five nine six .check out our go to go .call that number sure your family and friends how to use it .and we can get America covered once and for all so that the struggles that these folks have gone through and millions around the country and gone through .four years .finally get addressed .let me just remind people why I think this is so important .I respect rating suggested yesterday if you get cancer .you are seventy percent more likely to live another five years if you have insurance but if you don't .think about that that bad is what it means to have health insurance .set aside the the issues of security and and finances and how you're impacted my bad the stress involved in that knowing whether or not you're going to have health care this is life or death stuff .tens of thousands of Americans die each year just because they don't have health insurance .millions more live with the fear of the dollar broke if they get sick and today we begin to free .millions of our fellow Americans from that fifty .already millions of young adults and able to stay on their parents plans until they turn twenty six millions of seniors already have done that discount on the prescription medicines .already millions of families have actually received rebates from insurance companies within spent enough on the health care .this long means more choice more competition lower costs for millions of Americans .and this one doesn't just mean economic security for a family is it means what finally addressing the biggest drivers for a long term deficits .it means a stronger economy .remember most Republicans .I have made a whole bunch of predictions about this law but haven't come through .no death panels .cost seven skyrocketed the growing up the smallest rate and fifty years .the last three years since I signed the affordable Care Act in the law or the three slowest rates of health spending growth on record .and contrary to Republican claims as lies and destroyed our economy .or the past three and a half years our business of crater seven half million new jobs just today we learned about our manufacturers are growing at the fastest rate in two and a half years .may have factored in a formal character I don't think it's a problem what's weighing on a car is not the affordable Care Act my back car stint series of crazies .and the unwillingness to pass a reasonable budget by a faction of the Republican Party .I like every new or every new product rollout they're gonna be some glitches in the sign up process along the way that we will fax I've been saying this from the start for example we found out that there have been times this morning with a safe man running more slowly than it normally will .the reason is because more than one million people better health care dot gov before seven in the morning .to put that in context there were five times more users in the market place this morning many have ever been on Medicare dot gov at one time .that gives you a sense of how important this is to millions of Americans around the country that's a good thanks .and what I mean speeding things up in the next few hours to handle all this demand .bank sees anything that we expect .considering the just a couple of weeks ago apple rolled out a new mobile operating system .and within .bays they found a glitch Seoul expect it .I remember anybody suggesting apple should start selling iPhones or iPads or threatening to shut down the company they don't .so how we do things in America .we don't actually root for failure vehicle yet to work we make things out then we make a better we keep going .so in that complex I work with anybody who's got a serious idea to make the affordable Care Act work better I've said that repeatedly but as long as I am president I will not give in to reckless demands by some of the Republican Party so the night affordable health insurance to millions of hardworking Americans .I want it Republicans in Congress tonight these are the Americans you heard before if you were allowed to dismantle the slough Americans like Amanda Nancy information .who now finally about pursuing from basic security and peace of mind of health care just like everybody else including members of Congress .the notion that you'd you'd make .I condition for reopening the government that I make sure these folks don't have health care .it doesn't make any sense .it doesn't make any sense .now let me make one closing point .this Republican shutdown threatens our car amount of time when millions of Americans are still looking for work and businesses return to get some traction .so the timing is not good .of course a lot of the Republicans in the house ram for office two years ago promising to shut down the government then so apparently they've now gone the wish .most as I've said before about irony about Republicans have to contend weather's ation down almost part of the government but the affordable Care Act is still open for business .and that's maybe why you bothered many Republican governors and senators and even growing number of reasonable Republican congressman who are telling the extreme rate of the product to market off thousand budget Mance .and I want to underscore the fact that coverage doesn't just have to end the shutdown and reopen the government .current research generally has to start governing by crisis .about to break my family .it is a drag on the economy it is not really our best country .for example one of the most important things cameras out to do in the next couple weeks .is to raise what's called the debt ceiling .important understand what their service this is a routine vault car research taken this multi forty five times to refer that feelings as well Reagan took office it does not cost taxpayers a single dime it does not grow deficits may single dime it does not authorise anyone to spend any money whatsoever all it knows is authorised the treasury to pay the bills .I what current research has already spent .thank about about .if you buy a car and you got a current ultra .you do not save money by not paying your car note .you're just a dead beat .if you buy a house you don't save money by not authorising .yourself .to pay the mortgage .you're just gonna be for calls owner of .that's what this is about .it is routine it is what they're supposed to do this is not a concession to me it is not some demand between reasonable that I'm making this is what Congress responsibility as a routine matter .and they shouldn't wait until the last minute to do it the last time Republicans even threaten this course of action many of you remember back in two thousand eleven .or a car to be staggered or credit rating was downgraded for the first time .if they go through with it this time and for speed I have space to default on its obligations for the first time in history .would be far more dangerous than a government shut down as bad of a shut down it it would be an economic shutdown .so I'll speak more on this in the coming days but .let me repeat .I will not negotiate or regardless of responsibility to pay bills it's already racked up .I'm not going to allow anybody to drag the good name of the United States of America through the mind just to refight they settled or action or extract ideological demands .nobody gets to hurt our economy and millions of hard working families .or realise you don't like .the whole bunch of things that I'd like to see past regardless that the house Republicans haven't passed yet .and I'm not out there saying well I'm not I'm gonna left America default .unless cameras no something .the man I want to do that's not our .I don't operate .certainly that's not our government should I bring .and that's true whether there's a democratic in this .M. S. office or Republican in this office .don't matter whether the new democratic house represented the Republican controlled house representatives there certain rules that everybody might by because we don't want to hurt for other people just because we have a political disagree .so my mate my basic message regardless of best out of my job .M. government shut down .pay your bills .from an economic shutdown .don't wait long delay .don't put a car to me or people through this any longer .I'm more than happy to work with them on all kinds of issues .I want to get back to work .on the things that the American people set up their work on creating new jobs and growth in security for a middle class .what better than this .certainly the American people are a lot better in this .I believe the what we've accomplished for Amanda and Nancy and from needs and tens of millions of their fellow citizens on this day proved their .even when the other long about schools remaining .we are always want me a country but can do great things together .thank you very much everybody governments you thank you all of you for the great work that you're doing and thank you were scheduling to billions for the outstanding work that she's doing %HESITATION making sure that millions of Americans can get health insurance thank you for
