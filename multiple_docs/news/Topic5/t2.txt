A group of students in BHU protested against the proposal to make Reliance Foundation chairperson Nita Ambani a visiting professor at BHU by sieging the vice-chancellor residence. Students say that being the wife of a bourgeoisie can not be a measure of women empowerment. Students also warned that if Nita Ambani comes, she will oppose it and all this is being done under the promotion of privatization.Let us know, the Faculty of Social Sciences of Kashi Hindu University has also sent an invitation proposal to make Nita Ambani, Executive Director of Reliance Industries and Chairman of Reliance Foundation, a visiting professor. This proposal has been sent not by the BHU administration but by a department. The department says that this decision has been taken for the students studying in the Center for Women's Studies.When the news of Nita Ambani being made a visiting professor appeared in the newspapers, the students were exasperated. When they protested, the BHU administration said that they have no idea about it and no proposal for this method has been sent by BHU. If a department has sent something in person, then it cannot say but currently it is not from BHU. After this assurance from the Vice Chancellor, the students ended their protest.
