Europe is experiencing heat wave and draughts in last seven years,which is part of extreme weather related events in region for over 2000 yrs.Researchers analysed tree rings dating back to Roman rings.The researchers at Czech Globe Centre with these ill effects like early deaths ,crop destruction and forest fires ,a threat to agriculture and forestry .The region is becoming drier making it vulnerable to draught and wildfires.These impacts are expected to increase the intensity in coming decades.A 27000 growth rings from 147 oak trees has been analysed and published in a journal.For the last century, researchers referred to living oaks, along with timber from old buildings.For middle ages scientists also used oak flourishing in river deposits and wood in Roman period on which they determined temperatures from wood density and width.On checking for water available to trees they determined timeline and intensity of draughts. Turns out, what Europe experienced in the last few years is worse than what happened in the last 2,000 years.Recent summer draught in Europe are far more severe than anything in the past 2100 years which has impacted ecolgy , agriculture and economy of region.An International team led by cambridge's Department off Geography, studied the chemical fingerprints on European Oak trees to reconstruct Summer Climate over 2100 years spanning from 75BC to 2018.depend on the photosynthetic activity" and "oxygen values are affected by the source water. Büntgen  particularly enable to decode the complete pic of past draught variations, which helped them for functioning of ecosystem and societies.Climate change is not getting drier everywhere, some place can be wetter or colder to some extreme conditions which may be devastating for agriculture,ecosystem or whole. the tweet shared by U.K. Green Party also stated that if we dont reduce carbon emissions it will get worse.Trees anchor ecosystems by providing food, shelter, and myriad forms of support. If trees don’t get enough water, they become more susceptible to pests, disease, and fires. The study's authors warned that worsening droughts threaten trees.
