was launched, the cheapest Mini cost just more than £10,000.These days, buyers will have to fork out almost £11,500 to own a new Mini One, or even more for the Cooper S which costs up to £17,730.The Mini Convertible, which was launched last spring, costs up to £15,690 for the top model, and there is even a waiting list.Last year, MG Rover, which employs more than 6,000 people, produced just 110,000 cars, though it hopes to land a deal with Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation (SAIC) that could help double the number of cars produced at Longbridge.The Mini factory\\'s current output is equally impressive when compared with the main Rover factory in Longbridge, which in 1999 produced 180,000 Rover cars.BMW\\'s Mini adventure has made good much of what went wrong during its

majority control over Gazprom is the beginning of the liberalisation of the market in Gazprom shares,\" Mr Miller added.The merger of Russian gas giant Gazprom and oil firm Rosneft is to go ahead, but will not include Yugansk, which was controversially bought last year.Gazprom chief Alexei Miller confirmed Rosneft-owned Yugansk was not part of the deal and will instead be spun off.Speaking on NTV television, which is controlled by Gazprom, Mr Miller added that Yugansk, which was swallowed up by Rosneft late last year, will operate as a separate, state-owned oil firm headed by current Rosneft chief Sergei Bogdanchikov.\"Ultimately and industrially, Gazprom needs Yugansk,\" he added.But he said the latest development was simply an interim step to allow foreigners to trade in Gazprom.The merger, backed by Russian authorities, will allow foreigners to trade in Gazprom shares.The state wanted to control Gazprom before allowing foreigners to trade.Analysts said the deal would give Gazprom control of 8% of Russia\\'s total oil production, an improvement on its current 2.5%, but still far less than the 20% share it would have gained had it also taken over Yugansk.Yugansk was sold to a little-known shell company in a disputed auction in December, following what many thought was a politically-motivated attack on Yukos.', \"Belgian brewing giant Inbev has seen its profits soar

narrowed down to 14 key indicators, with an emphasis on creating jobs and economic growth.\"Lisbon is about everything and thus about nothing,\" the Kok report said.Mr Kok was commissioned by the European Commission in March this year to assess how far the EU has come towards meeting the Lisbon targets, five years on from their inception.But the Lisbon targets are about much more than just economic prestige.But some analysts believe that the Kok report doesn\\'t come up with the sort of innovative policies and thinking needed to make the Lisbon targets a reality.The economic targets set out at the Lisbon summit of European Union leaders in 2000 were meant to help Europe leapfrog its way past the United States to become the world\\'s leading economy by 2010.\"The [Lisbon] vision is a compelling one, but in order to do it society has to change,\" said Paul Hofheinz of the Lisbon Council, a Brussels-based citizen action group.On one point Mr Kok was very clear: The European Union should not try to emulate the US economy.But part of the problem was also linked to the original targets set out in Lisbon five years ago.But meeting the Lisbon targets requires a political commitment that no EU member state has volunteered so far.The Kok report tries to do away with a belief that jobs need to be sacrificed at the altar of economic growth.The European economic and social model needs to change, but not so much so that social and environmental issues take a backseat to economic growth.Lisbon risks becoming a \"synonym for missed objectives and failed promises\", his report said.Targets have a habit of coming back to haunt you and in the Lisbon case, they covered too much, according to the Wim report.\"The US suffered two years of economic slowdown and recession and the European economy followed suit.\"As Mr Kok\\'s report noted: \"The ink had scarcely dried on the [Lisbon] agreement before the worldwide stock market bubble imploded.\"The circumstances weren\\'t conducive to creating the 20 million new jobs promised by EU leaders in Lisbon in 2000.The EU\\'s economic growth rate is projected to be 2% this year and 2.4% next.For many economists and analysts

sold in the US, said GM Europe president Carl-Peter Forster.Bringing Cadillac production to Sweden should help introduce desperately-needed scale to the Saab factory, which currently produces fewer than 130,000 cars per year.GM\\'s plans to build the American marque in Sweden is part of its efforts to push it as an alternative luxury brand for European drivers.Doing so would remove the exposure

save it is not going to equip the US economy and government for the challenges of this new century.This upward trend will force increased borrowing by the federal government, putting upward pressure on interest rates faced by consumers and business.Reducing domestic spending, or eliminating \"waste, fraud and abuse\" is toothless because this slice of the budget is too small to solve the problem.The biggest spending growth areas are defence (including homeland security), and health care for the elderly and the poor.Savings in health care spending that do not come at the expense of health can only be achieved with wholesale reform of the entire system, public and private.Even now, a growing share of US borrowing is from abroad.US politicians and citizens of all political persuasions are in for a dose of shock therapy.Under direct threat will be the federal government\\'s ability to make good on its debts to the Social Security Trust Fund.By definition, the deficit means too little revenue and too much spending - but this neutral description doesn\\'t adequately capture the current situation.The trigger for the coming shock will be rising federal debt, which will grow in 10 years, by conservative estimates, to more than half the nation\\'s total annual output.From the standpoint of the big fiscal trends, the cuts are gratuitous and the big budget train wreck is yet to come.The US population is aging, and the nation does face genuine threats in the world.There will be no need for constitutional amendments to balance the budget.', 'Mr Sullivan is at

of $5bn.Military spending is also set to rise by 4.8%, to reach $419.3bn.The budget does not include the cost of running military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, for which the administration is expected to seek an extra $80bn from Congress later this year.The state department\\'s planned budget would rise to just under $23bn - a fraction of the defence department\\'s request - including almost $6bn to assist US allies in the \"war on terror\".\"In order to sustain our economic expansion, we must continue pro-growth policies and enforce even greater spending restraint across federal

in peril here,\" said Ahmed Shaheed, the chief government spokesman.Expectations of strong corporate earnings in 2005 drove the Indonesian stock exchange in Jakarta to a record high on Wednesday.In Sri Lanka, some economists have said that as much as 1% of annual growth may be lost.Indonesian, Indian and Hong Kong stock markets reached record highs.\"It won\\'t be surprising if the cost exceeds our GDP,\" he said.Shaheed noted that investment in a single tourist resort - the economic mainstay - could run to $40m.He estimated the economic cost of the disaster at hundreds of millions of

official in a briefing on Wednesday.However, many experts, including the World Bank, have pointed out that it is still difficult to assess the magnitude of the disaster and its likely economic impact.', \"Stock markets in Indonesia and India have hit all-time highs this week; even in Sri Lanka, more comprehensively affected, the main index has lost only 5% since the waves hit.Second, stock markets do not trade the sort of companies likely to have been damaged.The MSCI World share index, a measure of global stock market performance, hit its highest level this week since early 2001; the BBC Global 30 has risen by 3% in the past week.Even the costliest natural disaster is rendered minuscule by the global capital market - currently $30 trillion and rising.And where insurance certainly is in place - in, for example, the many tourist complexes affected - the costs will be borne in far-away corners of the global reinsurance market, rather than landing locally.The trillion-dollar debts of Japan's banks, for example, have had no effect on stock markets further afield than Tokyo.But disasters have a vast psychological impact, and markets are driven by psychological factors.In fact, the markets are being perfectly rational.And indeed, stock exchange traders around Asia have wasted little time regretting the victims of this week's disaster.Asian stock markets are heavily inclined towards property and construction companies, many of which will be rubbing their hands over the reconstruction opportunities.A study of the 1993 Des Moines floods, from the Disaster Research Center at the University of Delaware*, found that 70% of local businesses were no worse off after the disaster, and another 18% felt themselves better off.Bigger markets further afield have barely twitched.And

people are thought to have died, the rupee shed 0.1% against the dollar Analysts said that it was difficult to predict the total cost of the disaster and warned that share prices and currencies would come under increasing pressure as the bills mounted.Shares in Europe's leading reinsurers and travel firms have fallen as the scale of the damage wrought by tsunamis across south Asia has become apparent.The Thai baht lost 0.3% against the US currency, trading at 39.10.Shares fell just 0.03%.Investors pointed out, however, that declines probably would be industry specific, with the travel and insurance firms hit hardest.However, the overall impact on Asia's largest stock market, Japan's Nikkei, was slight.Reisurance firms such as Swiss Re and Munich Re lost value as investors worried about rebuilding costs.Travel companies also took a hit, with Japan's Kinki Nippon sliding 1.5% and HIS dropping 3.3%.Insurers and reinsurance firms were also under pressure in Europe.Germany's benchmark Dax index closed the day 16.29 points lower at 3.817.69 while France's Cac index of leading shares fell 5.07 points to 3.817.69.Travel-related shares dropped in Europe, with companies such as

calculations demonstrated what many Russian analysts already knew: that increasing the tax rate increases the amount that managers steal, since undeclared income becomes relatively more valuable.The net result, the authors say, is that the extra amount companies pay in tax is more than compensated for by greater efficiency and financial soundness.Since then, the Russian stock market has more than trebled in value, a rise the authors attribute at least in part to the newly tough approach.The report highlights the case of Sibneft, a Russian oil company that came close to merging with Yukos last year.\"An increase in tax enforcement can increase the amount [of dividends and other income] outside shareholders will receive, even accounting for increased levels of taxation,\" the authors say.According to the authors, although a variety of changes were sweeping through Russian industry at the time, the increase in tax enforcement is the only likely explanation for the change of fortunes at Sibneft and many of its peers.Genuine, disinterested tax collection might well work wonders in Russia; the problem with recent examples has been the erratic and unpredictable way laws are enforced.And the authors\\' definition of tax enforcement seems unrealistically Western.The paper\\'s reasoning is complex, and is based on a sophisticated model of the relationship between tax regimes and corporate governance - in particular, the propensity of management to steal from the company.On the other hand, increasing the rigour with which taxes are collected encourages companies to become more transparent, forcing them to be able to demonstrate their financial position far more accurately.For all its faults, corporate Russia has become far more orderly and law-abiding since 2000.', 'The owner of the technology-dominated Nasdaq stock index plans to sell shares to the public and list itself on the market it operates.The Nasdaq is made up shares in technology firms and

Trust Fund which is tax free, with any gifts from relatives that take the total above the annual £1,200 limit being directed to a deposit account.As the Child Trust Fund will not be in force in time for Christmas, relatives could invest their gifts in a higher rate children's deposit account, and use this as a feeder fund.If the account holds money gifted by friends and relatives - but not parents - any interest earned from the savings account may be set against the allowance.Where both parents and other relatives are saving on behalf of a child, consideration should be given to opening separate accounts - one for parents' gifts and one for gifts from other relatives.Interest earned by children is subject to income tax.The tax rules are different for parents who save on behalf of a child.There are accounts designed to start children off in the savings habit and they often pay a higher rate of interest.The only drawback with all financial gifts is that the children gain an absolute right to the money at age 18, and parents will have no control over how it is spent.This confirms that the account holder is a non-taxpayer and allows interest to be received without the deduction of income tax.The government is trying to encourage saving at an early age, through its new Child Trust Fund.Parents and relatives will be able to top up the fund with up to £1,200 a year, which will grow free of income and capital gains tax.Only £100 of interest (per parent) can be tax-free.It may encourage children to save or start a fund which could count towards university costs, for example.Where interest exceeds this level, the whole of the interest will be taxed on the parent.This is to prevent parents from holding their own cash savings in their children's names and taking advantage of the tax allowances.The parent or guardian will be responsible for the Bonds and will receive notification of the purchase.\", 'Merrill Lynch are sole bookrunners for Air China\\'s

second day, closing at three-month lows after news that US crude stocks have improved ahead of winter.The falls were triggered when the Energy Information Administration (EIA) said on Wednesday that US crude stocks were 3.5% higher than a year ago.However, some analysts believe the sharp fall in crude prices may harden Opec's attitude to over-production, leading to a scaling back of oil output.Weak US fuel and heating oil stocks have been a persistent factor in pushing up oil prices.Opec nations have increased production to 25-year highs to meet global demand and this has helped rebuild US stocks hit by supply disruptions after Hurricane Ivan in September.The price of crude is still up about 30% on the start of 2004, but has fallen from the record of $55.67 set in late October.The price of both benchmark crudes has dropped 12% in two days.Analysts also attributed the fall to mild early-winter weather, which has tempered demand for heating oil.The long-awaited drop in oil prices helped to ease persistent investor jitters over the impact of energy costs on company profits and economic growth.Analysts, however, say prices will fall further if inventories continue to rise.However, traders warned that the fall could be short-lived if there is a cold snap in North America this winter or any major supply problems in other parts of the world.\", 'Speaking at the

unit sales in 2004 were 6,798,000, an increase of 62,000 units from 2003.Recent new models introduced by Ford include the Ford Five Hundred and Mercury Montego sedans, the Ford Freestyle crossover, the Ford Mustang, the Land Rover LR3/Discovery, and Volvo S40 and V50 in North America and Europe.In addition, the company said 2004 net income was affected by a fourth-quarter pre-tax charge taken to reduce the value of a receivable owed to Ford by Visteon, a former subsidiary.But Ford declined to provide guidance for first quarter 2005.\", \"Wipro said demand was strong, allowing it to increase the prices it charged.Profit had been forecast to be 4.1bn rupees.Wipro, India's third-biggest software firm, has reported a 60% rise in profit, topping market expectations.Net income in the last quarter was 4.3bn rupees ($98m; £52m), against 2.7bn a year earlier.One problem identified by Wipro was the high turnover of its staff.\", '\"The retail sales figures are very weak, but as Bank of England governor Mervyn King indicated last night, you don\\'t really get an accurate impression of Christmas trading until about Easter,\" said Mr Shaw.The last time retailers endured a tougher Christmas was 23 years previously, when sales plunged 1.7%.A number of retailers have already reported poor figures for December.Retail sales dropped by 1% on the month in December, after a 0.6% rise in November, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said.Clothing retailers and non-specialist stores were the worst hit with only internet retailers showing any significant growth, according to the ONS.UK retail sales fell in December, failing to meet expectations and making it by some counts the worst Christmas since 1981.Yet, other retailers - including HMV, Monsoon, Jessops, Body Shop and Tesco - reported that festive sales were well up on last year.', 'Nearly 9,000 business leaders in 104 countries were surveyed for Business and HIV/AIDS: Commitment and Action?Across sub-Saharan Africa, even in countries with an HIV prevalence of 10-19%, only around 7% of companies have formal HIV/Aids policies in place, according to the report.The WEF report concludes that businesses need to understand their exposure to HIV/Aids risks and come up with good local practices to manage them.The WEF report shows that despite the fact that 14,000 people contract HIV/Aids every day, concern among businesses has dropped by 23% in the last 12 months.\"Effective action on HIV/Aids is synonymous with good business management and leads to more profitable and sustainable operations,\" said Brian Brink, senior vice-president, health, at Anglo-American.Nor could over 65% of the business leaders surveyed say or estimate the prevalence of HIV among their staff.The report adds \"an important building block to our understanding of how the business community is experiencing the HIV/Aids epidemic and to whether and how it is reacting,\" said David Bloom, professor of economics and demography at the Harvard School of Public Health.\"Too few companies are responding proactively to the social and business threats,\" said Dr Kate Taylor, head of the WEF\\'s global Health Initiative.Dr Taylor described the level of action taken by businesses as revealed by the report as \"too little, too late\".', 'EuroDisney will sell the new shares priced at 9 euros cents each.EuroDisney, the European home of Mickey Mouse and friends, has said it will sell 253m euros (£175m; $328m) of new shares as it looks to avoid insolvency.A new attraction - Walt Disney Studios - has recently opened its site near Paris.Despite struggling since it was opened in 1992, EuroDisney has recently made progress in turning its business around and ticket sales have picked up.', 'Children in the UK between the ages of 10 and 17 had an annual income of £775, said market analyst Datamonitor.They use \"pester power\" to get their parents to stump up nearly a third of this income, the report said.According to the Datamonitor report the trend marked British teenagers out as \"particularly important to cosmetics manufacturers as they are likely to experiment more with brands and products and form long-term beauty routines\".British children enjoy the highest average annual income in Europe - more than double that of Spanish or Italian youngsters, a report suggests.', \"The deal with Aggregates will give Holcim, the world's second-biggest cement maker, an entry into the UK market and boost its presence in the US.Swiss cement firm Holcim has bid $800m (£429m) to buy two Indian cement firms and a holding company in the country.It plans to buy Associated Cement Companies (ACC), Ambuja Cement Eastern and the holding firm, Ambuja Cement India Ltd, a Holcim statement said.ACC is India's second-largest cement maker with an annual capacity of 18.2 million tonnes and a market share of 13%.If the Indian deals go ahead, it will give Holcim a major presence in the world's fastest-growing market behind China.Meanwhile, UK-based firm Aggregate Industries said it had agreed a £1.8bn takeover by Holcim.\", \"However, Anil's demand that Anand Jain - another IPCL board member accused by Anil of creating a rift in the Ambani family - be thrown out, was not met.On Wednesday, the board of Reliance Energy, another Reliance Group company, reaffirmed its faith in Anil, who is the company's chief.The move follows a decision earlier this month by Anil - the younger brother of Reliance Group president Mukesh Ambani - to resign from his post.The ongoing public spat between the two heirs of India's biggest conglomerate, Reliance Group, has spilled over to the board meeting of a leading company within the group.Anil has accused Anand Jain, a confidant of his brother Mukesh, of playing a negative role in the Ambani family, and being responsible for the trouble between the brothers.Reliance Group acquired the government's 26% stake in IPCL - India's second-largest petrochemicals company - in 2002, as part of the privatisation drive.\", \"More than 2,000 business and political leaders from around the globe are arriving in the Swiss mountain resort Davos for the annual World Economic Forum (WEF).But much of the media focus will be on the political leaders coming to Davos, not least because the agenda of this year's forum seems to lack an overarching theme.The Brazilian city of Porto Alegre will host the rival World Social Forum, timed to run in parallel with the WEF's ritzier event in Davos.Mr Gates' company, software giant Microsoft, also hopes to use Davos to shore up its defences against open source software like Linux, which threaten Microsoft's near monopoly on computer desktops.However, many of the issues discussed in Porto Alegre are Davos talking points as well.UK Prime Minister Tony Blair and South African President Thabo Mbeki are among the more than 20 government leaders and heads of state leaders attending the meeting.Davos fans still hark back to 1994, when talks between Yassir Arafat and Mr Peres came close to a peace deal.Microsoft founder Bill Gates, the world's richest man and a regular at Davos, will focus on campaigning for good causes, though business interests will not be wholly absent either.The US government may still make a conciliatory gesture, just as happened a year ago when Vice President Dick Cheney made a surprise appearance in Davos.Davos itself is in deep frost.Mr Gates is said to be trying to arrange a meeting with Brazil's President Lula da Silva.Having already donated billions of dollars to the fight against Aids and Malaria, Mr Gates will call on world leaders to support a global vaccination campaign to protect children in developing countries from easily preventable diseases.At Davos, global problem solving and networking are never far apart.\", 'The budget deficit hit a record $412bn in the 12 months to 30 September 2004, after reaching $377bn in the previous fiscal year.The US budget deficit is set to hit a worse-than-expected $368bn (£197bn) this year, officials said on Tuesday.Past Congressional Budget Office (CBO) forecasts said there would be a $348bn shortfall in the 2005 fiscal year.The cost of military operations still needs to be factored in, with analysts saying the deficit could end up a further $100bn in the red.The CBO also forecast a total shortfall of $855bn for the years from 2006 to 2015, an improvement on previous projections.In November, the gap between US exports and imports widened to more than $60bn, a record figure.', '\"I can confirm that BaFin has passed through the case to the public prosecutor,\" a BaFin spokeswoman said.\"We are disappointed that the BaFin has referred to the prosecutor the question of whether action should be brought against individuals involved,\" Citigroup said.Traders at US banking giant Citigroup are facing a criminal investigation in Germany over a controversial bond deal.Germany\\'s financial watchdog BaFin told BBC News it had now transferred the investigation to the public prosecutor.However, under German criminal law, prosecutors cannot pursue Citigroup itself.The move was widely criticised at the time, and now the German regulator has said it has found evidence of possible market manipulation.', \"Brazil's unemployment rate fell to its lowest level in three years in December, according to the government.IBGE also said that average monthly salaries grew 1.9% in December 2004 from December 2003.The Brazilian Institute for Geography and Statistics (IBGE) said it fell to 9.6% in December from 10.6% in November and 10.9% in December 2003.The jobless rate average for the whole of 2004 was 11.5%, down from 12.3% in 2003, the IBGE said.The unemployment rate has been falling gradually since April 2004 when it reached a peak of 13.1%.However, average monthly wages fell 1.8% in December to 895.4 reais ($332; £179.3) from November.\", \"Indonesia, which originally accepted the debt moratorium offer, owes the Paris Club about $48bn (£25.5bn).Mr Bakrie told the Bisnis Indonesia newspaper that a $1.7bn donors' aid package meant that the debt moratorium was unnecessary.Indonesia no longer needs the debt freeze offered by the Paris Club group of creditors, Economics Minister Aburizal Bakrie has reportedly said.Nevertheless, one of Mr Bakrie's deputies, Mahendra Siregar, told AFP news agency that Indonesia was still considering the offer by the Paris Club of rich creditor nations to temporarily suspend its debt payments.Indonesia, Sri Lanka and the Seychelles accepted the Paris Club offer, which was criticised by some aid groups as being too little.The 19 member countries of the Paris Club are owed about $5bn this year in debt repayments by nations affected by the Indian Ocean tsunami.\", 'But a judge has barred Bank of America and two auditors from the case.The bank, and Italaudit - formerly the Italian arm of auditor Grant Thornton - face lawsuits and possible prosecution.A second auditor, Deloitte & Touche, has also been banned from the case.', \"And overall investment in fixed assets was still high, up 21.3% from the previous year - although some way off the peak of 43% seen in the first quarter of 2004.Despite the apparent rebalancing of the economy the overall growth picture remains strong, economists said.Growth in industrial output - the main target of government efforts to impose curbs on credit and investments - was 11.5% in 2004, down from 17% the previous year.China's economy has expanded by a breakneck 9.5% during 2004, faster than predicted and well above 2003's 9.1%.China raised rates by 0.27 percentage points to 5.8% - its first hike in nine years - in October 2004.China's economy is not only gathering speed thanks to domestic demand, but also from soaring sales overseas.But officials pointed out that industrial growth had slowed, with services providing much of the impetus.Despite urging to ease the peg, officials insist they are a long way from ready to make a shift to a more market-set rate.\", 'The Act also applies to firms with more than 300 US shareholders, a situation many firms without US listings could find themselves in.It obliges all firms with US stock market listings to make declarations, which, critics say, will add substantially to the cost of preparing their annual accounts.The US stock market watchdog\\'s chairman has said he is willing to soften tough new US corporate governance rules to ease the burden on foreign firms.The SEC has already delayed implementation of this clause for smaller firms - including US ones - with market capitalisations below $700m (£374m).Mr Donaldson said the SEC would \"consider whether there should be a new approach to the deregistration process\" for foreign firms unwilling to meet US requirements.The US regulator said foreign firms may get extra time to comply with a key clause in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.But European firms with secondary listings in New York have objected - arguing that the compliance costs outweigh the benefits of a dual listing.European firms have protested that US laws introduced after the Enron scandal make Wall Street listings too costly.Compliance costs are already believed to be making firms wary of US listings.Mr Donaldson said that although the Act does not provide exemptions for foreign firms, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) would \"continue to be sensitive to the need to accomodate foreign structures and requirements\".', 'In percentage terms, an average of 44% of respondents in each country said the world economy was getting worse, compared to 34% who said it was improving.The poll found that a majority or plurality of people in 13 countries believed the economy was going downhill, compared with respondents in nine countries who believed it was improving.The Philippines was among the most upbeat countries on prospects for respondents\\' families, but one of the most pessimistic about the world economy.Most respondents also said their national economy was getting worse.Almost 23,000 people in 22 countries were questioned for the poll, which was mostly conducted before the Asian tsunami disaster.The countries where people were most optimistic, both for the world and for their own families, were two fast-growing developing economies, China and India, followed by Indonesia.Citizens in a majority of nations surveyed in a BBC World Service poll believe the world economy is worsening.Pipa conducted the poll from 15 November 2004 to 3 January 2005 across 22 countries in face-to-face or telephone interviews.\"While the world economy has picked up from difficult times just a few years ago, people seem to not have fully absorbed this development, though they are personally experiencing its effects,\" said Pipa director Steven Kull.But when asked about their own family\\'s financial outlook, a majority in 14 countries said they were positive about the future.', 'European leaders say Asian states must let their currencies rise against the US dollar to ease pressure on the euro.The European single currency has shot up to successive all-time highs against the dollar over the past few months.China is seen as the main culprit, with exports soaring up 35% in 2004 partly on the back of a currency pegged to the dollar.But now Europe says the euro has had enough, and Asia must now share some of the burden.', 'Mr Elgindy was convicted of racketeering, securities fraud and extortion.Defense lawyers contended that Mr Royer had been feeding information to Mr Elgindy and another trader in an attempt to expose corporate fraud.Mr Royer was convicted of racketeering, securities fraud, obstruction of justice and witness tampering.Mr Elgindy had been trying to sell stock prior to the attack and had predicted a slump in the market.\"Under the guise of protecting investors from fraud, Royer and Elgindy used the FBI\\'s crime-fighting tools and resources actually to defraud the public,\" said US Attorney Roslynn Mauskopf.When the guilty verdict was announced by the jury foreman, Mr Elgindy dropped his face into his hands and sobbed, the Associated Press news agency reported.The charges carry sentences of up to 20 years.', \"The other is China Construction Bank.The latest scandal at Bank of China will do nothing to reassure foreign investors that China's big four banks are ready for international listings.Bank of China is the country's biggest foreign exchange dealer, while China Construction Bank is the largest deposit holder.Bank of China is one of two frontrunners in the race to list overseas.Although, he committed the offences whilst running Bank of China in New York, Mr Wang was head of China Construction Bank when the scandal broke.Earlier this month, a China Construction Bank branch manager was jailed for life in a separate case.The pair both worked at Bank of China in the northern city of Harbin, the South China Morning Post reported.The most high-profile case involved the ex-president of Bank of China, Wang Xuebing, jailed for 12 years in 2003.Two senior officials at one of China's top commercial banks have reportedly disappeared after funds worth up to $120m (£64m) went missing.China's banks used to act as cash offices for state enterprises and did not require checks on credit worthiness.\",

warned that it was not benefiting since much of the traffic was in containers destined for ports.', \"The government has rejected the 60% rise and wants Aguas Argentinas to make an annual investment of 400m pesos ($136m; £72.3m) in improvements.But last week, Argentine Economic Minister, Roberto Lavagna, told the French media in Paris that the government was considering allowing a 16% increase in tariffs and the possibility of a State contribution to Aguas Argentinas infrastructure investments.He added that the government is in discussions with Aguas Argentinas about what role it might take in the event that a State contribution is agreed.A conflict between the Argentine State and water firm Aguas Argentinas, controlled by France's Suez, is casting doubt on the firm's future.The Planning Minister didn't rule out the possibility of cancelling Aguas Argentinas water concession.In Argentina, Suez's subsidiary, which has been fined for cutting the supply of water during a recent heat wave and allegedly failing to keep up investment to meet the demand for water, has maintained a tense relationship with the Argentine government.On May 2004, Aguas Argentinas and the government signed an agreement to renegotiate its Buenos Aires water-concession contract.He added that in the coming weeks the future of Aguas Argentinas would be decided.Suez owns 40% of Aguas Argentinas (39.9%), while Spain's Aguas de Barcelona is its second biggest shareholder with 25.01%.However, Aguas Argentinas told the Argentine newspaper Clarin it would not accept any change to its legal structure and, in practice, this rules out State participation on its board.He has also asked for more investments to meet the growing demand for water.\", \"Butane gas and fuel oil are used as the main source of fuel

globalisation, for fair trade, and many other causes.A survey published on the eve of the conference by PricewaterhouseCoopers said four in ten business leaders were \"very confident\" that their companies would see sales rise in 2005.Aside from Mr Blair, more than 20 other world leaders are expected to attend including French President Jacques Chirac - due to speak by video link after bad weather delayed his helicopter - and South African President Thabo Mbeki, whose arrival has been delayed by Ivory Coast peace talks.The World Health Organisation (WHO) said 700,000 people in poor countries were on life-extending drugs - up from 440,000 six months earlier but amounting to only 12% of the 5.8 million who needed them.Showbiz figures will also put in an appearance, from U2 frontman Bono - a well-known campaigner on trade and development issues - to Angelina Jolie, a goodwill campaigner for the UN on refugees.In contrast, the Davos forum is dominated by business issues - from outsourcing to corporate leadership - with bosses of more than a fifth of the world\\'s 500 largest companies scheduled to attend.Climate change and the fight against Aids are leading the list of concerns for the first day of the World Economic Forum in the Swiss resort of Davos.Some 2,000 business and political leaders from around the globe will listen to UK Prime Minister Tony Blair\\'s opening speech on Wednesday.', \"China accounted for 20.1% of Japan's trade in 2004, compared with 18.6% for the US.During 2004, Japan's trade surplus grew 17.9% to 12.011 trillion yen, with more than half the surplus, 6.962 trillion yen, accounted for by its trade with the US.It compares with 20,479.5bn yen in trade with the US.China overtook the US to become Japan's biggest trading partner in 2004, according to numbers released by Japan's Finance Ministry on Wednesday.This is the highest figure for Japanese trade with China since records began in 1947.In 2003, the US was ahead with 20.5%

chairman of Spain's most powerful bank, Santander Central Hispano, has started in Madrid.In spite of the allegations against him, Mr Botin continues to lead Santander, and was instrumental in the £8.5bn takeover last November of the British bank Abbey National.Mr Corcostegui, a former CEO at Santander, also asked the court for new evidence to be admitted.Mr Botin is accused of misusing the bank's funds after he approved the payment of 160m euros ($208m; £111m) in bonus and pension payouts to two former executives.\", 'Simon Rubinsohn, chief economist at Gerrard, said: \"This outturn (of 0.7%) was well ahead of the market expectations and cast doubt on the scare stories doing the rounds surrounding the current state of the UK economy.\"The ONS said the services sector, which accounts for nearly three-quarters of the UK economy, grew 1.0% in the quarter.The ONS said a sharp fall in mining and quarrying, which was driven by oil and gas extraction, was primarily responsible for the overall contraction in manufacturing production figures.And he said the GDP figures may help to \"push interest rate expectations a little higher along the curve\".The UK economy grew by an estimated 3.1% in 2004 after accelerating in the last quarter of the year, says the Office for National Statistics (ONS).The annual figure marked out the best year since 2000, and was also well ahead of the 2.2% recorded in 2003.\"The fact that other services components are doing so well suggests to me that we are back to trend (growth) and I am not particularly concerned about any further slowdown,\" said Ross Walker, UK economist at RBS Financial Markets.But Steve Radley, chief economist at the manufacturers\\' organisation EEF, said: \"These figures remain at odds with what is actually happening on the ground.', 'Several former HealthSouth employees have already pleaded guilty to fraud and are expected to give evidence against Mr Scrushy.Defence lawyers said Mr Scrushy had been deceived by other executives.Richard Scrushy, 52, is accused of \"directing\" a $2.7bn (£1.4bn) accounting fraud at the company he co-founded in Alabama in 1984.\"We will present evidence that Richard Scrushy knew about the conspiracy, that he participated in the conspiracy and that he profited,\" prosecutor Alice Martin told the court.', 'Possibly as a result, the worry about low-cost competition has slightly fallen from last year, with just 54% of companies calling it a \"significant threat\" or \"one of the biggest threats\".More than 90% of large companies around the world are highly optimistic about their economic prospects, a survey of 1,300 bosses suggests.When business advisers PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) conducted the same survey two years ago, nearly 30% of bosses were gloomy about their prospects.According to Frank Brown, global advisory leader at PwC , the trend of large companies to have global operations has one clear upside: \"One risk in one region - for example the Middle East - won\\'t kill your business anymore.\"- For the survey, PricewaterhouseCoopers interviewed 1,324 chief executives throughout the world during the last three months of 2004.But PwC\\'s global chief executive, Samuel DiPiazza, said a growing number of companies were also concerned that moves to outsource work to cheaper countries could both hurt their reputation in their home markets and harm the quality of service they provide to their customers.', \"LVMH said the French designer's haute couture and ready-to-wear labels had been purchased by the Falic Group for an unspecified
